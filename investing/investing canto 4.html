<h3>What is diversification and why should you care?</h3>
      
<p>Diversification is dividing up your investment portfolio among a bunch of different 
  things instead of putting it all in one investment. The word &quot;different&quot; 
  is very important in that sentence, because there are two reasons to diversify 
  your investments. 
<h4>Reason 1: Avoiding Disaster</h4>
<p>This one is pretty obvious. If you put all your money in the stock of one company 
  and then that company goes belly-up, you end up with nothing. Classic &quot;eggs 
  in one basket&quot; problem - not hard to understand. Of course, if you have 
  all your money in one stock and the company does fantastically well, you'll 
  be pretty happy. For most people, the risk of failure is too great to bet all 
  their retirement money on one thing. 
<h4>Reason 2: A Smoother Ride</h4>
<p>Here's where the word &quot;different&quot; comes in. If you just divide your 
  investments among a bunch of different stocks that are all in the same industry 
  - like putting a fifth of your money in each of the big five Canadian banks, 
  for example - you're not going to get very much diversification. In times that 
  are good for banks they will all go up together, and in times that are bad for 
  banks they will all go down. There will be times when one does better than the 
  others, but the effect will be small. What you really want to do is invest in 
  companies that are all on a general path upwards, but with bends in the path 
  that occur at different times. Let me illustrate with some pictures.
<p>Let's say Bob decides to invest in a company called Even Years Holdings. Even 
  Years always performs really well in years that end in an even number. In odd-numbered 
  years it tends to slump. (Perhaps its customers have some kind of weird superstition.) 
  Anyway, Bob is generally making money from his investment, but those slumping 
  years always worry him, and he therefore doesn't sleep as well in odd-numbered 
  years. Here's a graph of how his money has grown in the years he has owned Even 
  Years Holdings:

<p>All the time that Bob has been investing in Even Years, Edith has been investing 
  in a company called Odd Years Incorporated. Odd Years performs really well in 
  years that end in an odd number and slumps in years that end in an even number. 
  Edith is making about the same money over time as Bob, but the slumping years 
  worry her, too, so she has trouble sleeping in even-numbered years. Here's a 
  graph of Edith's investment:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="OddYears.jpeg" width="486" height="417"></p>
<p>One day Bob is at Tim Horton's ordering a large double-double and an apple 
  fritter, and Edith is at the other till ordering a mango smoothie and an apple 
  fritter. The two Tim Horton's associates realize there is only one apple fritter 
  left and ask Bob and Edith what they want to do. Bob and Edith take one look 
  at each other and decide to share the doughnut. One thing leads to another and 
  soon they get married. When they combine their portfolios, an interesting thing 
  happens. They're still making the same amount of money, but the graph looks 
  really straight and there are no slumping years. As a result, Bob and Edith 
  find it very easy to sleep together. They live happily ever after. Here's the 
  graph of their investment happiness:</p>

<h4>A Few Final Notes</h4>
<p>From what I've read, investing in about 20 stocks is enough to achieve a diversified 
  portfolio as long as they're in several different industries. When you're just 
  starting out, you can't really do that on your own. It's hard to buy individual 
  stocks in amounts less than 100 shares at a time, and lots of stocks cost $10 
  or $20 per share. Some of them can be hundreds of dollars per share. To buy 
  20 different individual stocks would be hard to do with a portfolio smaller 
  than about $50,000. That's why beginning investors often start by buying shares 
  in some kind of fund that invests in a bunch of different stocks. That way with 
  a fairly small amount of money you can buy tiny pieces of a lot of different 
  stocks. (By a fund, I'm referring to things like mutual funds or exchange-traded 
  funds, but I'll talk more about them another time.) There are also things called 
  &quot;investment clubs&quot; where individuals pool their money to buy as a 
  group, but I don't know that much about them. Anyway, there are a variety of 
  ways to diversify, and you should do it.
