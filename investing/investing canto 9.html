<h3>Index Funds</h3>
      
<p>In all the categories of funds we've talked about so far (mutual funds and 
  ETFs, RRSPs and TFSAs, stock funds, bond funds, etc.) there are funds that are 
  called index funds. In most of these categories there are also actively managed 
  funds. So what's the difference?
<h4>First, What the Heck is an Index?</h4>
<p>There are a wide variety of market indices out there, to measure how well different 
  markets are doing. For example, there's a thing called the S&amp;P 500 Index. 
  A company called Standard and Poors (S&amp;P) maintains a list of the 500 largest 
  companies traded on the US stock exchanges. Largest is measured based on the 
  number of shares that exist multiplied by the current value of those shares 
  on the market. So these are 500 really big companies. In their calculation, 
  they include a number of shares for each company that will make its percentage 
  of the index proportional to its market size. Since the value of the individual 
  shares is constantly changing, so is the value of the index as a whole. They've 
  been making these calculations for these 500 companies since 1957 (and they've 
  had other indices since even before that). Of course, the companies in the index 
  aren't the same as they were in 1957. For example, if two companies merge, then 
  there are only 499 companies, so they have to add another one at the bottom. 
  I guess if a company split in two and became two companies that were both big 
  enough to be in the index, they'd have to knock one out. People pay attention 
  to the value of the S&amp;P 500 index because it's a pretty good measure of 
  how well the stocks of big American companies are doing on average.
<p>There are other indices that track even smaller groups of companies (like the 
  Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has existed since 1896 and tracks 30 large 
  companies). There are others that track medium sized companies or small companies, 
  or even the entire stock market. There are indices that track the bond market, 
  or different parts of the bond market. There are indices that track the markets 
  in Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and every other country that has a stock 
  market. There are indices that track groups of these countries, like Europe 
  or Latin America. There are indices for particular sectors of the market, like 
  technology or health care. Seriously, the Wikipedia list of market indices goes 
  on for pages and pages. If you can think of a way you could subdivide the market, 
  someone has probably made an index for that. And the someone is generally some 
  kind of independent firm of market analysts who make their living doing that 
  kind of stuff.
<h4>Index Funds versus Actively Managed Funds</h4>
<p>In an actively managed fund, there is a manager or a team of managers who study 
  the market and decide what things to buy and sell. If a bunch of people like 
  you decide to put more money into their fund, they have to decide what securities 
  to buy with that money. There will be a plan for the fund, laid out in its prospectus, 
  that determines what sorts of things they are supposed to buy. For example, 
  if the prospectus says the fund is supposed to invest in Canadian corporate 
  bonds, the management team won't go out and buy stocks in some Brazilian mining 
  firm with your new money (or they can be fired). But within the limits of what's 
  laid out in the investment scheme in the prospectus, they are supposed to study 
  the various securities available to them, try to predict what things are going 
  to do well, and buy and sell stuff on that basis. 
<p>An index fund is pretty different. An index fund holds the securities that 
  are part of a market index. The company that manages the fund is just trying 
  to slavishly follow the list of securities that are in the index, and hold them 
  in the same proportion as the index indicates. For example, if you buy shares 
  in a mutual fund that says it tries to match the S&amp;P 500, your new money 
  should be used to buy new shares in the companies listed in that index. The 
  people who manage the fund don't have to do any research, because they can just 
  get the information from Standard and Poors listing which companies they are 
  supposed to own. They hardly have to buy and sell things (except when investors 
  give them new money or take money out), because the shares in the index change 
  only very slowly, and usually only around the bottom of the index. 
<h4>Why are Index Funds Good?</h4>
<p>Index funds are good mostly because they are cheap. Since the management team 
  doesn't have to do any research, or engage in much deep thought, they don't 
  have to be high-flying financial experts with yachts and expensive luxury automobiles. 
  As long as they are competent to handle the buying and selling, manage the accounts 
  of their investors, file taxes on time, and basic stuff like that, they can 
  manage an index fund. That means the percentage of your money that goes into 
  management fees is generally a lot lower. In the US, sometimes it can be *really* 
  low. For example, some bond funds in the US charge as little as 70 cents per 
  year for every $1,000 you have in there. That's in contrast to some actively 
  managed stock funds, where the managers can charge people $30 for every $1,000 
  or sometimes even more. </p>
<p>I'll be devoting a whole article to the costs of mutual funds, so I won't go 
  further with that now, but what else is good about index funds? One thing is 
  that it encourages you to park your investments for the long term and not think 
  about them too much. The thing is that if your mutual fund or ETF is going to 
  just slavishly follow the index (minus a very small annual fee), you don't really 
  have to worry about whether you've made the right choice of funds. It's not 
  going to outperform the market, but it's not going to underperform it by much 
  either. If you put your money in an actively managed fund and it does well compared 
  to the market, that's great, but if it starts to slump compared to the market 
  (as they all do eventually), you'll start worrying about whether you made the 
  right choice.</p>
<h4>When are Actively Managed Funds Worthwhile?</h4>
<p>I think actively managed funds have a role to play in markets that are not 
  well-understood. When you're talking about the 500 biggest publicly-traded companies 
  in the US, there is huge information available to investors. By law, they have 
  to reveal information about their finances and operations on a certain schedule, 
  and everyone gets access to it. Nobody gets much of an information advantage 
  over anyone else in trading these companies. This is sometimes called an &quot;efficient&quot; 
  market. I think markets like that are where an index fund makes the most sense.</p>
<p>In markets for very small companies, or in some overseas markets, the information 
  is sometimes scarce and sometimes unreliable. Markets like that are sometimes 
  called &quot;inefficient&quot; markets. I think in those cases an active management 
  team can find out things that other people might not know, and therefore might 
  make better decisions about which securities to buy and sell. </p>
<p>In other cases, the index has so many companies in it (some of the small company 
  indices have thousands) that it's not really practical for a fund to own them 
  all. In those cases, there may also be a role for active management in selecting 
  the subset of companies the fund will own.</p>
<h4>So which should you choose?</h4>
<p>I think in general the core of an investment portfolio should be index funds. 
  Actively managed funds should be used selectively to invest in inefficient markets.
