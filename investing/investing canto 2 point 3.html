<h3>Equity</h3>
      
<p>This category of investment has the highest risk of changes in value among 
  these three types, but also has the highest potential for profits. Equity securities 
  are usually called stocks, or shares in a company. They are issued by companies. 
  Some stocks pay dividends to the shareholders and some don't. People who buy 
  the stocks that don't pay dividends are expecting to make a profit when the 
  shares go up in value.
<p>If you buy a stock you are buying a piece of the company that issued it. That's 
  why it's called a share. You become a part owner of the company. Most shares 
  give you voting rights in how the company is run, though if you don't own very 
  many shares you don't have very many votes. Companies that make a profit can 
  pay some of it to the shareholders in the form of dividends, can use some of 
  it to buy back shares (and thereby push up their price somewhat), or can put 
  the profits back into the business to develop new products and so on. Some well-established, 
  stable companies, like electric utilities or banks, pay dividends reliably year 
  after year. Some new companies in industries like high-tech, are very busy growing 
  and don't pay dividends at all. Shares generally never mature. If you want your 
  money back out of them, you have to sell them through some kind of stockmarket, 
  usually through a broker. That means someone has to want to buy them from you. 
  If you are fortunate, the buyer will want to pay you more than you bought them 
  for and you will make a profit. If the buyers only want to pay less than you 
  paid for them and you're determined to sell them anyway, you will lose some 
  money.
<p>If a company gets into financial trouble, the shareholders can actually lose 
  all their money. Companies that go bankrupt are obliged to pay their loans (including 
  bonds you might own) before they pay anything to the shareholders. Sometimes 
  there is nothing left for the shareholders. On average, though, this doesn't 
  happen to most stocks. Over the long term, stocks tend to offer more profit 
  than either of the other two kinds of investments. That's why people buy them.
<p>You can buy stocks directly through a broker, but in the U.S. only about a 
  third of stocks are owned by individual households. I'm not sure what the percentage 
  is in Canada. Anyway, most people buy stocks through a stock fund - they buy 
  shares in a fund that owns lots of different stocks. That way your nest egg 
  is in more baskets. Here are some kinds of stocks you might buy, either directly 
  or as part of a fund:
<ul>
  <li>Blue-chip stocks - these are stocks issued by big, well-established companies</li>
  <li>Growth stocks - these are stocks issued by companies that are expected to 
    grow rapidly</li>
  <li>Value stocks - these are stocks issued by companies that are probably worth 
    more than their share price would suggest (or at least the buyers hope so)</li>
  <li>Large-capitalization stocks - these are stocks issued by companies that 
    are worth a total of more than $10 billion altogether</li>
  <li>Mid-capitalization stocks - these are stocks issued by companies that are 
    worth a total of between $2 billion and $10 billion</li>
  <li>Small-capitalization stocks - these are stocks issued by companies that 
    are worth a total of between $300 million and $2 billion</li>
  <li>Micro-capitalization stocks - these are stocks issued by companies that 
    are worth a total of between $50 million and $300 million</li>
  <li>There are even nano-capitalization stocks, but probably not many that trade 
    on established stock markets</li>
  <li>Stocks from a particular sector of the economy, such as health care or energy</li>
  <li>Socially responsible stocks - these are stocks from companies that strive 
    to be responsible in terms of the environment, the rights of workers, and 
    so on</li>
</ul>
If you are saving for a long-term objective - something you'll need the money 
for in five years or more - you should consider including investments in this 
category. Conventional wisdom (particularly American conventional wisdom) would 
advise that the longer it is until you need the money, the more you should have 
in stocks and the less you should have in bonds. In Canada, the advantage stocks 
have over bonds has been a lot smaller. From 1980 to 2012, earnings from stocks 
were just a fraction of a percent better in an average year than earnings from 
bonds. The returns from the bonds were also a lot steadier. I think that means 
that a Canadian investor should be comfortable including more bonds in their portfolio 
than a US investor might.
