<h3>Should You Invest?</h3>
      
<p>Yes and no.
<h4>Yes</h4>
<p>Everyone is going to tell you to start your investing early. This is because 
  of the amazing power of compound interest. Here's some math:
<p>Let's say you plan to put money into some investments that will average a 5% 
  annual return over and above inflation. That's not an unreasonable expectation 
  for stock market investments over the long term. You plan to retire at 65. If 
  you put $1000 into the account at different ages, here's what it will be worth 
  when you turn 65 (remember this is <b>after</b> inflation, so the actual amounts 
  would be more than this):
<ul>
  <li>Put in at 25, worth $7,040 at 65</li>
  <li>Put in at 35, worth $4,322 at 65</li>
  <li>Put in at 45, worth $2,653 at 65</li>
  <li>Put in at 55, worth $1,629 at 65</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's some more math. If you want a quick way of finding out how fast an investment 
  will grow, use a rule of thumb called variously the &quot;Rule of 70&quot; or 
  the &quot;Rule of 72.&quot; If you divide 70 or 72 (whichever makes the math 
  easier) by the interest rate you expect, it gives you the number of years until 
  the investment doubles. So if you're making 8% per year, 72/8 = 9, so you should 
  expect your investment to double in about 9 years.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this math is just to say that if you start saving earlier, you 
  have more money at the end. Pretty obvious, but the numbers above are striking.</p>
<h4>No</h4>
<p>There are lots of reasons why it might not make sense to get involved with 
  the stock or bond market at this stage. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You're working in the summer to save money for the following school year. 
    The time between putting the money aside and needing to use it is so short 
    that you really shouldn't take the risk that the value of your investments 
    might fall. Stick with investments in the cash category or just keep your 
    money in a good savings account. The on-line ones tend to pay more interest.</li>
  <li>You're still in university and your best investment is in your own skills 
    and qualifications. The return on an investment in education is pretty good 
    and likely more reliable than the stock market. If you have to choose between 
    the two, invest in yourself first.</li>
  <li>You make too little money to owe taxes at the moment. If that's the case, 
    it makes no sense at all to open a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) 
    or something of that sort. You'll probably be paying a higher tax rate than 
    zero when you take the money out, so you'd be transfering income from a year 
    when you don't pay taxes on it into a year when you do. That's just dumb. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone's situation is different, but the basic rule is that if the main things 
  you need money for are coming up fast (less than five years) you should be saving 
  or using cash type investments, and if the things you want to save for are long 
  term (like retirement, education for your children, or down payment on a house) 
  you should be investing on stocks or bonds.
