<h3>Bank of Dad has Written a Piece of Software</h3>
      
<p>The Bank of Dad has written a piece of software with the working title of &quot;Investment 
  Analyzer&quot;. It is going to be posted as a zip file you can download and 
  try out. It is currently only a beta version, so is being distributed as freeware. 
  You can download and try it, but please let me know if you do. The email address 
  is below. Please do not distribute it to others without asking them to contact 
  me and let me know they have it. 
<p>I am looking for feedback so I can make improvements to it. If it seems like 
  something people will want, I'll change it to a shareware product and start 
  charging people something like $5. Or a beer. Or a chocolate truffle. Or an 
  extra $5 donation to your favourite charity while thinking fondly of the Bank 
  of Dad. 
<p>The Investment Analyzer has two functions. a) It can analyze a group of funds 
  and their returns history and develop a set of optimized mixtures with the lowest 
  year-to-year variability for a given average rate of return. b) It can analyze 
  a portfolio of investments and a range of retirement expenditure plans and estimate 
  the probability the investor will outlive his/her money.
<h4>Mixture Optimization</h4>
<p>When I started investing, I learned that asset allocation and diversification 
  were important parts of investing success, but that there was something called 
  &quot;false diversification&quot; that could trip up an investor. False diversification 
  is where you split your money between two funds that basically behave the same 
  way. You think you are lowering your risk by spreading your money between different 
  things, but actually you are making no difference at all. I wanted to be able 
  to estimate, based on past results, which of my funds went in different directions 
  from each other and would therefore provide me with useful diversification.
<p>In 1996 I wrote a little piece of code in Pascal, to grind through my collection 
  of mutual funds and try to figure out the best allocation between them for the 
  average rate of return I wanted. I ran it on my computer at work, which was 
  faster than anything we had at home, and it often had to run overnight. Since 
  then I have re-written it twice, because of various computer upgrades, and each 
  time I added more features. The computer I run it on now is over 1000 times 
  as fast as the one in 1996, so it can consider a lot more fund combinations 
  a lot more quickly as it develops its optimized mixtures.
<p>To use it you assemble a little text input file (which you can build in a spreadsheet 
  and export to comma-separated text if you want), with information on the funds 
  you want it to work with, the range of years for which you have returns, and 
  the total return for each year for each fund. You can also specify a couple 
  of target levels of return and standard deviation, like for a low-risk portfolio 
  and a medium-risk portfolio. You can specify the &quot;step sizes&quot; the 
  program will use to mix the funds together. For example, if you specify a step 
  size of 100%, the program will compare only portfolios that consist entirely 
  of one of the funds. If you use a step size of 50%, the program will compare 
  all the portfolios with everything in one fund and also all the portfolios split 
  evenly between two of them. It can use step sizes of 100%, 50%, 25%, 20%, 10%, 
  5%, 4%, 2%, and 1%. If you specify that it should start with a step size of 
  100% and move through to a step size of 1%, it will run a pass at every step 
  size in between and each time will use the information it gains to narrow down 
  the choices it needs to consider in the next pass. 
<p>Each time it looks at a portfolio mixture, it figures out the total return 
  for each year for the mixture. From that, it calculates the average annual return 
  and the standard deviation of the returns. Then it tries to store these results 
  in a bin for the best portfolio with approximately this rate of return. If this 
  is the first portfolio with this rate of return, the program plops it in that 
  bin. If there is already a portfolio stored in that bin, the program compares 
  the standard deviations. If the new one has a lower standard deviation, it replaces 
  the portfolio that was already stored in the bin. Otherwise, the program moves 
  on to the next mixture. 
<p>At the end, it can draw a chart that shows the best standard deviation available 
  for each rate of return, and the fund mixture that produced that standard deviation. 
  You can pick a place on the chart that represents the rate of return/standard 
  deviation you want and read off the mixture of funds that would have produced 
  thos results based on the returns history. Of course, past performance does 
  not predict future results. You don't know what the market conditions will be 
  going forward, so you can't predict which of your funds will do well. But the 
  relationship between them, in terms of which ones go up when another one goes 
  down, is probably more predictable. 
<h4>Outliving Your Money</h4>
<p>Over the years I've used spreadsheets to track our investments and often done 
  some kind of simple calculation in the spreadsheet to forecast whether our funds 
  would grow enough to pay for our retirement. A few years ago, I wrote a VBA 
  macro that would cycle through a range of retirement ages and a few different 
  retirement spending levels and, for each combination, estimate the probability 
  that we would outlive our money. It used the average return and standard deviation 
  for the overall portfolio to generate the return for each year, combined that 
  with the planned contribution or withdrawal, and repeated this for each year 
  until our estimated year of expiry. Then it repeated that whole process 999 
  more times, tallied up the results and calculated the percentage of time we 
  ran out of money in 1000 trials. Then it repeated the same process for the next 
  combination of retirement age and retirement spending level. This is called 
  stochastic simulation, or the Monte Carlo approach.
<p>I have now rewritten this and added it to the same program as the mixture optimization 
  system. To use it, you again assemble a little text input file (again, you can 
  do that in a spreadsheet and export it to comma-separated text if you want), 
  with information on the investments you have in your portfolio and their historical 
  returns, how much you plan to contribute each year until you retire, the pensions 
  you expect to get from company or government sources and when you will start 
  getting them, when you plan to retire, what you think your spending pattern 
  might be in retirement, the inflation rate, the tax rate you expect to pay in 
  retirement, and so on. Then it runs through 1000 trials for each scenario and 
  reports the results in a chart. It runs about 1200 times as fast as it does 
  in the spreadsheet macro, so if you want to use more trials you can do so. 1000 
  seems adequate for me.
<p>Because my parents are already retired and I wanted to be able to assess their 
  situation, I added the capability of running the stochastic model for someone 
  who is already retired. It works the same way, but instead of a range of retirement 
  ages to consider, you enter the range of ages you might live to, to test the 
  probability of running out of money before that age.
<p>There are various on-line programs for doing something very similar to this. 
  They allow you to experiment with various things, such as when you start your 
  Canada Pension Plan or Old Age Security payments (the monthly payment for each 
  of those is higher if you delay starting it after the &quot;normal&quot; retirement 
  age), what age you will retire, how much you plan to contribute, how much you 
  think you might spend in retirement, and how long you think you might live. 
  There were always aspects of my situation that didn't fit into the on-line calculators, 
  so I wrote my own. For example, we have retirement accounts we established when 
  we lived in the US, and other ones we set up after we moved to Canada. None 
  of the on-line calculators allow you to enter information in two different currencies. 
  My tool does that. It also doesn't limit how many pensions you enter, so if 
  you expect to get CPP and OAS and a company pension, but also Social Security 
  (in US$), you can enter all of that. You can specify whether pensions are taxable 
  or not, whether they are indexed to inflation, and so on. Basically, I built 
  the tool I needed myself, and I'm hoping it might be useful to others. 
<h4>If you Download the Software, What do You Get?</h4>
<p>The file is posted as a zip file, which you download and then unzip. To install 
  it, you run the setup.exe and it should install as an application called Investment 
  Analyzer. It runs in Windows, so if you are an Apple user you would have to 
  run some kind of Windows emulator to use it. I'm not sure how old a version 
  of Windows it will work on. I'm using Windows 10 and haven't tried it on anything 
  else.
<p>There is also a Word file with instructions on how the input files work. It 
  lists all the possible KEYWORD options a line of data can start with, and what 
  the program is expecting to see after each KEYWORD. 
<p>There is a directory of sample input files. You can try running them. They 
  only thing I know of that won't work is saving the results to an output file. 
  The input file currently has a nonsensical entry for the folder where you want 
  the output file to go, so it will probably throw an error. You can edit the 
  file and change the output directory to a directory that exists on your computer 
  and then it should work.
<p>When you decide to enter your own data, I recommend you start with one of the 
  sample input files that is closest to the scenario you want to run and make 
  changes to it. That will be easier than starting from scratch.
<h4>The Download</h4>

<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>This software is being distributed as a freeware beta version at the moment. 
  If you download it, please send me a note at the email below to tell me that 
  you did so. If you pass it on to someone else, please ask them to email me and 
  let me know they have it.
<p>I would like feedback on it so I can make it better. In the long run, if people 
  find it useful, I'd like to make it a shareware and ask for some nominal payment 
  from people who like it.
