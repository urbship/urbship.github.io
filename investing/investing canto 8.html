<h3>RRSPs versus TFSAs</h3>
      
<p>So let's assume that you've decided to start saving for a long-term objective, 
  such as retirement. As a Canadian, you can choose between two main tax-sheltered 
  types of accounts. The Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) lets people 
  subtract the money they put in from the income they report on their tax forms, 
  but then they have to pay tax on the money when they take it out. The Tax-Free 
  Savings Account (TFSA) doesn't let people subtract the contribution from their 
  income on their tax forms in that year, but they don't have to pay tax on the 
  money when they take it out. (By the way, for US readers, the RRSP is something 
  like the IRA in the US, and the TFSA is something like the Roth IRA. I'm not 
  going to talk about those here - you should find another article about them.)
<h4>How are they similar? </h4>
<p>The RRSP has been around since 1957 and the TFSA has only been around since 
  2009, but there are lots of things about them that are similar: 
<ul>
  <li>You can generally establish accounts for either in most of the same places. 
    You can set them up at a bank, a brokerage, an on-line broker, and a bunch 
    of other kinds of places.</li>
  <li>You can generally keep the same kinds of things in them: stocks, bonds, 
    mutual funds, ETFs. You can probably even hold pork bellies in your RRSP or 
    TFSA if you want to.</li>
  <li>With either of them, you can choose how much hand-holding you get from the 
    place where you set up your account. For example, most of the accounts you 
    set up at a bank are structured so that the bank has a duty to advise you 
    on what investments you should make, based on your risk tolerance and the 
    amount of time until you will need the money. At the other end of the scale, 
    you can set up a &quot;self-directed&quot; account at an on-line broker, and 
    they will pretty much leave you alone to make your own choices.</li>
  <li>With both of them, you don't have to report the earnings of the account 
    when those earnings are just staying in the account and not being given to 
    you. They act differently when you start taking money out.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How are they different?</h4>
<p>From a tax standpoint, RRSPs and TFSAs are kind of inverses of each other, 
  but there are also other differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you put your money into your RRSP account, you are allowed to subtract 
    the amount you put in (as long as you didn't exceed your limit for the year) 
    from the income you report on your tax form. In fact, if you put it in before 
    then end of February, you can subtract the amount from the previous year's 
    income. Then you'll get a tax refund just a couple of months later. When you 
    put your money into your TFSA, you don't subtract it from your income on your 
    tax form.</li>
  <li>When you take the money out, you have to pay tax on your RRSP withdrawal 
    as though it is new income in that year. When you take money out of the TFSA, 
    you don't have to report it as income or pay tax on it. </li>
  <li>One implication of that is that the income that happens in an RRSP during 
    the years when it was just growing does get taxed as you remove it. The income 
    that happens in the TFSA during its years of growth never actually gets taxed.</li>
  <li>The other implication is that the RRSP kind of lets you move the year when 
    income seems to occur, from the viewpoint of Canada Revenue. Basically you 
    are canceling some income in the current year and having it pop into existence 
    in a much later year. You would do that if you think your current income is 
    likely higher than it will be when you need the money. If you think you make 
    less money now than you likely will when you need the money, you should not 
    use an RRSP. A TFSA is a much better plan for that situation.</li>
  <li>A lot of institutions are marketing TFSA accounts that are basically just 
    savings accounts or GICs. (Not sure why, but RRSPs like that are not pushed 
    to the same extent.) That would mean you'd be saving for a long-term objective 
    using only the &quot;cash&quot; category of investments. Go back to <a href="investing%20canto%202.html">Canto 
    2</a> to find out why that's dumb. Also, you're going to all the trouble of 
    setting up this fancy type of account in order to get a tax break on a minuscule 
    amount of income. If you're not going to hold income or equity types of investments 
    in your TFSA, don't even bother.</li>
  <li>They have different contribution limits. In 2014, you can put up to 18% 
    of your previous year's income up to a maximum of $24,270 into an RRSP. You 
    have to adjust this if your employer provides a pension for you. You can put 
    up to $5,500 in a TFSA. In both cases, unused contribution limits from previous 
    years accumulate.</li>
  <li>You can't put any new money into an RRSP after you are 71. You have to roll 
    it over into a Registered Retirement Income Fund, after which it is mandatory 
    to start taking the money out. You don't have to stop funding a TFSA after 
    71, or take money out of it if you don't want to.</li>
  <li>There are only two reasons you can take money out of an RRSP before retirement, 
    without paying penalties: buying a house, or pursuing a higher education. 
    Then there are strict requirements for paying the money back in. The TFSA 
    is much more flexible about allowing withdrawals.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What if you have to file taxes to the US?</h4>
<p>My kids are dual citizens, so once they get beyond a certain income threshold, 
  they're going to have to file to the US. The RRSP is recognized as a retirement 
  tax shelter by the IRS, and although you still have to report it in a couple 
  of ways, it's not all that onerous. </p>
<p>The TFSA requires the same level of reporting as we've been doing for the Registered 
  Education Savings Plan (RESP):</p>
<ul>
  <li> We report the income on our 1040 form, </li>
  <li>We report it as a foreign account on the Foreign Bank Account Reporting 
    (FBAR) form, </li>
  <li>We have to make up our own 3520A form even though the IRS seems to expect 
    our bank to do that for us, </li>
  <li>We have to fill out the 3520 based on the 3520A we made up, and </li>
  <li>We have to report the mutual funds held in the account in an 8621. </li>
</ul>
<p>We're filling out all these forms for accounts on which we have never owed 
  any tax to the US, but if we don't fill them out (or if we screw them up) we 
  can be subjected to fines. It's truly ridiculous. So if you have to file to 
  the US, think twice before setting up a TFSA. If you're not comfortable around 
  tax forms, you're going to need lots of help.</p>
<h4>So which should you choose?</h4>
<p>If you make less than about $43,000 per year at the moment, you probably don't 
  want to start an RRSP. Chances are you'll be making more money in the year when 
  you want to use the money, so you'll pay more tax altogether. If you're making 
  less than that, you should probably choose a TFSA. (If you have to file taxes 
  to the IRS, get some help to figure out what it's going to mean in terms of 
  filing requirements.)
