<h3>Investing for Dividends</h3>
      
<p>Bonds and bond funds pay regular dividends. Some stocks pay dividends and some 
  don't, depending on how much of the company profits are reinvested in the business 
  and how much are handed out to shareholders. Investors invest in dividend-paying 
  stocks and the funds that invest in them for a couple of reasons: to provide 
  current income (for retirees, for example), or to have the relative certainty 
  of getting a dividend every year, which can be more reliable than the returns 
  from growth in share prices. This blurb won't focus on bond investing, since 
  we've talked about that quite a bit and because all bonds pay dividends. Instead, 
  it will discuss dividend-paying stocks (and stock funds) and how they compare 
  as an investment strategy.
<h4>What are Dividend-Paying Stocks?</h4>
<p>Companies that pay regular dividends to their shareholders tend to fall in 
  the <a href="investing%20canto%2014.html">value</a> category of the stock market, 
  but not always. They tend to have relatively <a href="investing%20canto%2013.html">low 
  P/E ratios</a>. They are usually in well-established industries, like food or 
  appliances, so they are not trying to expand rapidly and therefore they can 
  hand out some of their profits to shareholders. You can invest in dividend-paying 
  stocks either directly through a broker or through a dividend stock mutual fund 
  or ETF.
<p>There is a sub-category of dividend-paying stocks called the &quot;dividend 
  aristocrats.&quot; These are companies that have reliably paid dividends and 
  have increased the payout per share for at least 25 consecutive years. Among 
  the S&amp;P 500 (the largest 500 companies traded on the US stock exchanges), 
  there are currently 54 companies that fall in this category. Interestingly, 
  they include ten different business sectors and also include both growth and 
  value companies. There are ETF options to invest specifically in the dividend 
  aristocrats.
<h4>How Does Dividend Stock Investing Compare with Other Investment Styles?</h4>
<p>A long-term study of the US stock market (1928 to 2013) divided all the stocks 
  listed on four exchanges into non-payers of dividends and quintiles of dividend-paying 
  stocks (the 20% with the lowest dividend yield, the 20% with the next lowest 
  yield, and so on). They found that over the long haul, companies paying more 
  dividends tended to outperform, but the best performing group was the second-highest 
  dividend quintile. The average annual performance of the fourth quintile was 
  over 3% higher than the non-paying group, with much lower variability from year 
  to year. This is significant enough to be worth factoring into your investment 
  planning - it's a difference that even ranks up there with differences in management 
  fees. If you want to read more about that study, <a href="http%7C//www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Dividends-A-Review-of-Historical-Returns.pdf">check 
  it out here</a>. 
<p>The authors speculated about why it's the <b>second-highest</b> quintile that 
  performs the best instead of the highest quintile. They suggested that it may 
  be because some of the highest-yielding companies have unsustainable dividends, 
  and may strive to keep their dividends high even while the company is failing. 
  The second-highest quintile would include companies with more reliable dividend 
  programs and better long-term business prospects. 
<p>The one concern I have about this approach is that this is theoretical and 
  not based on real funds. Hindsight is always a great way to invest, but can 
  you tell which companies are going to be in which quintile in advance? How does 
  this work with real funds? 
<h4>How Well Does this Work with Real Funds?</h4>
<p>I found three dividend-oriented ETFs that I could compare against a plain jane 
  ETF that invests in the S&amp;P 500 index of large capitalization US stocks. 
  Each of them had at least eight years of return history. One of them specializes 
  in the dividend aristocrats, tracking the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats 
  Index, one of them tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, and 
  the third tracks the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. 
<p>All three of them had management expense ratios somewhat higher than the S&amp;P 
  500 Index ETF I was comparing them to, though in one case it was only 0.1% instead 
  of 0.07%. Two out of three of the funds outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF 
  by an average of about 0.6% per year and had lower variability from year to 
  year. The third fund lagged the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF by about 1.5% per year 
  and had higher variability from year to year.
<p>It seems to me that this brief analysis is promising but not conclusive. Based 
  on the long-term outperformance of the stocks that had high dividend yields 
  (chosen based on hindsight), and the fact that on average the ETFs based on 
  this strategy seem to at least keep pace with the broader index, that two out 
  of three of the ones I looked at outperformed and had less variability from 
  year to year, there seems to be some merit to this strategy.
<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
<p>Although in general I approach investment styles with a pretty skeptical eye 
  and like to remind people to stick to the basics and keep their costs low, this 
  particular style seems to have some merit. It might be for you if you consider 
  the following aspects:
<ul>
  <li>Are you at a stage in your investing when higher dividend yields would be 
    helpful to you? For example, do you need retirement income?</li>
  <li>If you are investing in ETFs or mutual funds, pay attention to costs and 
    choose from among funds with expense ratios competitive with your other investment 
    choices. </li>
  <li>One of the potential advantages of these dividend funds is that their return 
    is steadier from year to year. That also seems to correlate with better performance. 
    It might be better to lean towards a fund with steadier performance from year 
    to year.</li>
  <li>If you are investing in individual stocks, look for stocks that are not 
    the absolute high fliers in terms of dividend yield, but rather are in the 
    second tier and have a steady, long-term pattern of providing dividends. I 
    think the dividend aristocrats are a promising group to consider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhat to my surprise, I find myself recommending a specific investment style. 
  Particularly if you are in retirement, it seems to me a combination of bond 
  investing (especially for Canadians, where bonds have historically performed 
  well) and dividend-oriented stocks would provide steady income and good performance 
  over time.
