<h3>Cash</h3>
      
<p>This category of investments has very low risk of dropping in value, but doesn't 
  rise much either. Because of the low risk, investments in this category don't 
  pay much in the way of interest or dividends. In fact, sometimes a good savings 
  account at an on-line bank will pay a higher rate of interest, so there is kind 
  of a fuzzy line between this category of investment and your savings. Here are 
  some of the things that fall in this category: 
<ul>
  <li>Guaranteed Investment Certificates (in Canada) or Certificates of Deposit 
    (in the U.S.), which you often get at a bank or credit union and which pay 
    a fixed rate of interest for a specific term.</li>
  <li>Money market funds, which you can sometimes get through a bank or credit 
    union, but also from mutual fund companies. These funds buy and sell short-term 
    financial securities, like loans that last less than a year. Some are issued 
    by governments (like treasury bills) and some are issued by companies (often 
    called commercial paper). The direct trading in these securities is generally 
    done by large institutions, such as from one bank to another. Individual investors 
    generally participate by buying shares in a money market fund. The share value 
    in a money market fund usually stays the same (in over 20 years of investing, 
    using several different money market funds in Canada and the U.S., I've never 
    seen the share value change in any of them). They pay dividends to the investor, 
    usually once a month, based on the interest coming in from the securities 
    the fund is buying and selling.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are trying to save for something that you're going to need money for 
  in a short time - well under five years, for instance - you should mostly use 
  cash type investments for that.</p>
