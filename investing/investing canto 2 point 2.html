<h3>Income</h3>
      
<p>This category of investments has a higher risk of changes in value than the 
  cash category, but also tends to have higher dividend payments. Income securities 
  are usually called bonds. They can be issued by governments at all levels, or 
  by companies. 
<p>If you buy a bond when it is originally issued, you are lending your money 
  (the face value of the bond) to the government or company that issued it. They 
  agree to pay you interest on a regular basis. The interest is called the coupon, 
  because back when bonds were pieces of paper you kept in a safe deposit box, 
  you used to actually clip the coupons off and redeem them for money. At the 
  end of the term of the bond, the holder of the bond can redeem it for the face 
  value. The amount of interest the issuer has to offer is related to how risky 
  investors think they are. There are several rating services that study governments 
  and companies and attach ratings to them, to help issuers and investors decide 
  how much interest is appropriate for new bond issues. These rating services 
  are trying to figure out what the chances are that the entity might get into 
  financial trouble and be unable to pay the interest, or worse, be unable to 
  pay the face value back at the end. This is called credit risk or default risk.</p>
<p>Usually once a bond has been issued, it can be resold on the bond market. Sometimes 
  it can be sold for more than the face value and sometimes for less. This depends 
  mostly on what interest rates have done since the bond was issued. For example, 
  if the bond you hold has an interest rate of 5%, but new bonds from the same 
  institution are now paying 6%, people are not going to be willing to buy your 
  bond for its original face value. The amount they'll offer you is quite mathematical 
  - it's the fraction of the face value that will make the effective interest 
  rate for the remainder of the term equal to 6% instead of 5%. Similarly, if 
  interest rates have dropped to 4%, they'll be willing to offer you more. This 
  is called interest rate risk. Interest rate risk diminishes as you get close 
  to the end of the bond's term, because soon it is going to pay back its face 
  value. Another reason why your bond might be worth more or less than its face 
  value on the bond market is because the rating services changed the credit rating 
  of the government or company since you bought it.</p>
<p>You can buy bonds directly through a broker, but in the U.S. only about 10% 
  of bonds are owned by individual households. I'm not sure what the percentage 
  is in Canada. Anyway, most people buy bonds through a bond fund - they buy shares 
  in a fund that owns lots of different bonds. That way your nest egg is in more 
  baskets. Here are some kinds of bonds you might buy, either directly or as part 
  of a fund:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Government bonds - these are issued by governments to finance either specific 
    projects or general operations</li>
  <li>Municipal bonds - these are issued by city or state governments and have 
    a special tax status in the U.S. The federal government treats their dividends 
    as exempt from taxes, so they can actually offer a lower rate of interest 
    and still be competitive with other bonds.</li>
  <li>Corporate bonds - these are issued by companies</li>
  <li>High-yield bonds - these are issued by entities with lower credit ratings 
    and therefore have to pay more interest (and their value bounces around more)</li>
  <li>Junk bonds - these are issued by entities with really low credit ratings</li>
  <li>Long-term bonds - these don't mature (pay back their face value) until at 
    least 12 years after they are issued</li>
  <li>Medium-term bonds - these mature between 6 and 12 years after they are issued</li>
  <li>Short-term bonds - these mature between 1 and 5 years after they are issued</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are saving for a long-term objective - something you'll need the money 
  for in five years or more - you should consider including investments in this 
  category. Conventional wisdom (particularly American conventional wisdom) would 
  advise that the longer it is until you need the money, the more you should have 
  in stocks and the less you should have in bonds. In Canada, the advantage stocks 
  have over bonds has been a lot smaller. From 1980 to 2012, earnings from stocks 
  were just a fraction of a percent better in an average year than earnings from 
  bonds. The returns from the bonds were also a lot steadier. I think that means 
  that a Canadian investor should be comfortable including more bonds in their 
  portfolio than a US investor might.</p>
