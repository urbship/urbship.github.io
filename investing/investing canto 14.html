<h3>Growth and Value: How Important is Investment Style?</h3>
      
<p>Two popular &quot;styles&quot; of investing are growth and value. Within a 
  given country's market, and within an overall size category (such as large capitalization 
  companies), you can select stocks that that are either value-oriented or growth-oriented 
  or on the continuum somewhere in between. What do these things mean and how 
  important are they?
<h4>Growth Investing</h4>
<p>Growth investors primarily invest in growth stocks, which are shares of companies 
  that are expected to grow faster than the average for the stock market as a 
  whole. They tend to be in industries like high tech, where the companies are 
  trying to expand rapidly and therefore invest most of their profits back into 
  the firm.That means they don't tend to distribute dividends to the shareholders. 
  A company in the growth category will typically have a high <a href="investing%20canto%2013.html">P/E 
  ratio</a>. You can invest in growth stocks either by buying them directly through 
  a broker or by finding a growth-oriented mutual fund or ETF.
<p>Growth stocks tend to grow more than the market average during market upswings. 
  Particularly towards the end of a bull market, when the market has been rising 
  for a while, growth stocks develop a sort of momentum as investors jump on the 
  bandwagon and buy these exciting rising stocks. On the other hand, in bear markets, 
  growth stocks often fall faster than the rest of the market.
<h4>Value Investing</h4>
<p>Value investors primarily invest in value stocks, which are shares of companies 
  that are selling at a low price relative to their earnings or other ways to 
  measure the value of the a company. In other words, investors buy these stocks 
  because they think they are on sale. They tend to be in well-established industries, 
  like food or appliances, and they are usually not trying to expand rapidly so 
  they are able to distribute some of their profits to the investors. That means 
  they tend to have <a href="investing%20canto%2013.html">high dividend yields 
  and low P/E ratios</a>. You can invest in value stocks either by buying them 
  directly through a broker or by finding a value-oriented mutual fund or ETF.
<p>Value stocks tend to lag growth stocks during market upswings, but they don't 
  fall as much in down markets. Their total returns include dividends as well 
  as the change in stock price with time. Many investors find the relative certainty 
  of getting a dividend each year reassuring, because dividends are fairly reliable. 
  Many companies have been distributing dividends every year for decades, even 
  in years when their stock price goes down a bit.
<h4>How Do They Compare?</h4>
<p>An <a href="http%7C//mutualfunds.about.com/od/ValuevsGrowth/a/Value-Vs-Growth-Investing.htm">analysis 
  of year-by-year results</a> for US stock mutual funds (using data from Morningstar.com 
  for the years 2002-2011) compared growth mutual funds, value mutual funds, and 
  <a href="investing%20canto%209.html">index</a> mutual funds in three different 
  size categories. The results were not the same in all three size categories, 
  but using large stock funds as an example, growth funds had the largest returns 
  in four of the years, value funds had the largest returns in three of the years, 
  and index funds had the largest returns in three of the years. The 10-year annualized 
  returns for the three categories were: 4.12% for index, 4.09% for value, and 
  4.04% for growth. This is a statistical tie. The spreads were a bit wider in 
  the other two size categories. For mid-capitalization stock funds, index funds 
  came out ahead by a margin of about 2%, and for small capitalization stock funds, 
  value funds came out ahead by a bit over 1%.
<p>If you picked a different time period, you would get different results. For 
  example, if you picked a period when the market was generally rising, growth 
  funds would tend to win. If you picked a period when it was generally falling, 
  value funds would tend to win. Unfortunately, this only works for the past since 
  you never know what kind of period you are heading into. 
<p>I think in general that people with an aggressive attitude to investing and 
  a long investment horizon would tolerate the volatility of growth funds better 
  than people who are more conservative or who are investing for a goal that is 
  closer in time. For people who want to diversify between the two approaches, 
  index funds are a good choice, partly because on average they tend to have lower 
  fees.
<h4>How Important is Style?</h4>
<p>I think investment style should be fairly low down on your list of things to 
  consider when picking funds. The following choices all seem more important to 
  me:
<ul>
  <li><a href="investing%20canto%203.html">Should you be investing at all</a>?</li>
  <li>How should you <a href="investing%20canto%205.html">allocate your money</a> 
    by investment category?</li>
  <li>How <a href="investing%20canto%204.html">diversified</a> are your investments?</li>
  <li>How much money should you put in <a href="investing%20canto%207.html">international</a> 
    investments?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, given the modest difference between the three styles among large US 
  stock funds, I think the difference between styles is much less important than 
  the fees you might pay if you are investing in mutual funds and ETFs. (If you 
  are buying stocks directly, this is less of an issue.) The difference in annual 
  returns between large cap index funds and large cap growth funds was only 0.08% 
  per year. The difference between what an average Canadian mutual fund charges 
  in fees and what an average Canadian ETF charges in fees is 1.7% per year. That's 
  over 20 times as large a difference. You can't predict what type of market we 
  will have for the next ten years, but you can expect funds to continue charging 
  roughly the same fees from year to year. Therefore, whether you pick growth 
  or value or index styles, or some combination, make sure you pay attention to 
  costs.
