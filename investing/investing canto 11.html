<h3>Three Simple Rules</h3>
      
<p>Having written enough other cantos to provide the background for these, I'm 
  now going to talk about the Bank of Dad's three simple rules of investing.
<h4>1. Don't Worry Too Much About the Details</h4>
<p>With the exception of costs (see rule #2), it's not worth worrying too much 
  about which specific funds you put your money into. The biggest difference in 
  how much money you make from your investments comes from the types of investments 
  you choose, not from the specific investments. Look back at the <a href="investing%20canto%205.html">discussion 
  of asset allocation</a>. If you look at the variation in results among a group 
  of investors, 90% of the difference comes from their decisions about how much 
  they each put into stocks, bonds, or cash type investments. Decisions about 
  which specific stock fund to use only account for 10% of the differences. 
<p>One really good reason not to worry too much about the details is that you 
  can suffer from analysis paralysis. Confronted by a vast sea of mutual funds 
  and ETFs offered by numerous companies, you might just not do anything at all 
  and leave your money in your savings account. If you have decided that the time 
  is right for you to invest (see the <a href="investing%20canto%203.html">discussion 
  on whether to invest</a>), then you need to get going. Otherwise, inflation 
  will eat your lunch.
<h4>2. Pay Attention to Costs</h4>
<p>Canadians are too passive about how much their investment managers charge them, 
  often for services they don't use or need, and sometimes for no value at all. 
  Costs are a detail you should worry about. Don't pay more than you should. See 
  the <a href="investing%20canto%2010.html">discussion on costs</a> for more about 
  this.
<h4>3. Don't Obsess</h4>
<p>Once you've got your money invested, don't pay too much attention to it. I 
  look at how my investments are doing once a month. I typically move things around 
  a bit to rebalance the portfolio once a year. Sometimes ten years will pass 
  before I ever move money out of an account. Don't be a day trader - be a decade 
  trader. 
<p>If you've made good choices about asset allocation and you've paid attention 
  to costs, you should be able to park your money and let it ride. This will minimize 
  the costs (to you and/or the fund company) of frequent trading, and it also 
  minimizes your time investment. Your time is valuable, too, so get things set 
  up and then go do something you enjoy.
