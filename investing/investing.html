      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The Bank of Dad is a virtual bank that has existed in our house since 
        the children were small. For years the only form of mortgage we carried 
        on our house was a home equity line of credit that you can slop money 
        in and out of at any time. Therefore, when the kids entrusted us with 
        their savings, it had the net effect of reducing the balance we carried 
        on our equity line. It seemed only fair to pay them interest at the rate 
        we were paying on the mortgage. We tracked their balances in Quicken and 
        their interest accrued monthly. So that's the Bank of Dad. 
      <p>The Bank of Dad was asked for its opinions on investing. BoD has decided 
        to try writing a beginner's guide to investing in the form of a series 
        of short notes, each covering just one aspect of investing. They will 
        be posted at irregular intervals on this site and will remain up until 
        such time as they seem useless. If we learn of inaccuracies or lack of 
        clarity, we're open to revising them.
