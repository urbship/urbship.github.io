<h3>Socially Responsible Investing</h3>
      
<p>We have been supporters of the concept of socially responsible investing and 
  have always had some of our investment portfolio in funds that incorporate social 
  screens. Our experience has not been particularly inspiring. I think over the 
  next few years we're going to get our money out of the socially responsible 
  funds where we currently have it, and we'll have to explore other options. Fundamentally, 
  I think socially responsible investing can work. It has a cost, but as long 
  as you know what that is you can make your own decisions about whether that 
  cost is worth it to you. You also have to go into socially responsible investing 
  with the same ideas in mind that you would be thinking about with any other 
  investing. 
<h4>Our Experience</h4>
<p>We started out with some money invested in the Dreyfus Third Century Fund. 
  The Dreyfus Third Century Fund started in 1972 and is one of the oldest and 
  largest socially responsible funds in the US. We eventually moved our money 
  out of Dreyfus, because the returns seemed somewhat lackluster. 
<p>We moved our socially responsible investing over to a company called Citizens 
  Funds, which offered a range of socially responsible funds, including stock 
  funds, bond funds, and money market funds. Some of their funds were structured 
  to follow a socially responsible index, which seemed to offer the promise of 
  lower expenses and therefore more net returns into the shareholder's pocket. 
  They also seemed to be emphasizing industries that had less environmental impact 
  (high tech instead of oil, for example), and for a while that strategy looked 
  brilliant. Then came the technology crash in the early 2000s and their funds 
  haven't looked so good since then.
<p>It might be useful to compare three funds we've owned that are similar in terms 
  of what they invest in: stocks of large U.S. companies. We've owned three such 
  funds throughout a 14-year period beginning at the start of 2000: Vanguard Growth 
  Index Fund, Vanguard Windsor II Fund, and Citizens Index Fund (which later merged 
  into the Sentinel Sustainable Core Opportunities Fund). If we had put $1000 
  into each of those funds on January 1, 2000, by the end of 2013 we would have 
  this much in each of them:
<ul>
  <li>Vanguard Growth Index: $1,420</li>
  <li>Vanguard Windsor II: $2,670</li>
  <li>Citizens/Sentinel Sustainable: $1,045</li>
</ul>
<p>Making $45 over a 14-year period is certainly pretty lame. That's an average 
  of 0.3% per year. The Growth Index Fund averaged over 2.5% per year and the 
  Windsor II Fund averaged over 7% per year. Part of this is probably due to costs. 
  Vanguard is known to be a very frugal organization in terms of management expense 
  ratios. The Growth Index fund charges investors 0.24% in management expenses 
  each year, and the Windsor II fund is a bit higher at 0.36%. As of 2015, Sentinel's 
  fund was charging 1.26% in management expenses each year. All things being equal, 
  you would expect Sentinel to pay out about 1% less to the investor each year 
  after expenses, compared to these other funds. Based on the figures above, though, 
  it's actually paying out over 2% less than the Growth Index Fund, and way less 
  than Windsor II. This is pretty disappointing. </p>
<p>The Sentinel company has since merged with a company called Touchstone. Touchstone 
  will continue to offer most of the same funds as socially responsible funds, 
  but some of them have been merged with other Touchstone funds to make larger 
  mutual funds. I'm not sure of the full story behind this. It's not that uncommon 
  for mutual funds to disappear by merger if they haven't done all that well. 
  It's a way of making a track record that's very hard to market kind of go away. 
  Or it may be that the fact that I've seen a mutual fund company merge twice 
  in the time I've owned shares just means I'm getting old.</p>
<h4>Is Socially Responsible Investing Inevitably Disappointing?</h4>
<p>No, I don't think so. In principle, we should be able to invest in socially 
  responsible funds without taking a huge hit on investment returns. We need to 
  apply the same kinds of approaches I've been talking about in other blurbs in 
  this series:
<ul>
  <li>Invest in the right categories of investments for our time horizon - riskier 
    things if it's long time until we need the money and safer things if it's 
    a short time.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to costs. This might involve choosing funds that follow an 
    index, and it also might involve choosing ETFs instead of mutual funds.</li>
  <li>Leave the investments alone once we've made our choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the organizations that publish indexes have created socially responsible 
  indexes. For example, there is one called the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index that 
  applies social screens to the largest companies in the US to create an index 
  of 400 large companies. The companies they include have high Environmental, 
  Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings. The non-social index this would compare 
  most closely with is the S&amp;P 500 Index of the 500 largest US companies. 
  Over the five-year period between 2009 and 2013, the MSCI KLD 400 index averaged 
  total returns of 14.6% per year. In the same period, the S&amp;P 500 index averaged 
  total returns of 15.6% per year. If you take a longer period, starting in April 
  1990 (roughly when the KLD 400 index started) and going all the way to 2011, 
  the MSCI KLD 400 index actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index, returning 
  about 9.7% per year compared to 9%. Of course, these are returns for the indexes 
  and not funds based on them, so there are no fund expenses involved. Nonetheless, 
  from this example it looks like you can't really draw conclusions about which 
  index will outperform the other - it seems to depend on which period you choose 
  to look at.</p>
<p>If you're interested in Canadian socially responsible indexes, there is another 
  interesting pair to look at. The Jantzi Social Index was established in 2000 
  and includes 60 Canadian companies that are screened for a broad set of environmental, 
  social, and governance rating criteria. It is most closely comparable to the 
  S&amp;P/TSX 60 Index of large Canadian companies. I found it difficult to find 
  comparisons of the performance of the two indices over time, but I did find 
  two ETFs that are each designed to mimic these two indexes. They are both managed 
  by the same company. The five-year period from 2009 to 2013 shows the socially-responsible 
  ETF outperforming the regular one. Again, you'd get different results depending 
  on which period you chose to look at.</p>
<p>I think the bottom line is that you can probably do better than we have done, 
  because it seems like your options are better now. I don't think we can draw 
  too many conclusions about long-term performance of these indices, but it looks 
  like they perform similarly to the benchmark non-social indexes if you don't 
  account for costs. From what I can see among the ETFs that I've looked at, you 
  seem to pay about an extra 0.4% of your money in management expenses to own 
  a socially responsible ETF instead of a similar ETF that is not socially responsible. 
  All things being equal, therefore, I think you can probably expect to see 0.4% 
  less per year in net returns from your investments, if you make this choice. 
  A lot of people would consider that to be worthwhile. The main thing is to understand 
  the cost and make an informed choice.</p>
<h4>How Would I Do Socially Responsible Investing if I were Starting Now?</h4>
<p>I would choose an ETF that is designed to mimic an index like the MSCI KLD 
  400 or the Jantzi Social Index. Those indexes seem to perform about as well 
  as their corresponding non-social indexes, and you can get ETFs that mimic them 
  and charge only about 0.5% to 0.55% per year in management expenses. If it's 
  worth it to you to pay about 0.4% more in expenses in exchange for a cleaner 
  conscience about your investing, you should look into it.
