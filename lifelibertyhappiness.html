<H1> Fun with Statistics</H1>

<p>I gathered statistics on different countries so I could look at the correlations 
  between different things.
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>I attempted to investigate whether nine different national indices of freedom 
  correlated positively with various national statistics that are somewhat reflective 
  of protections for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I found that 
  countries scoring high on most of the indices of freedom do have better statistics 
  in these three areas. The indices of property rights, freedom from corruption 
  and business freedom correlated most positively. The indices of limited government, 
  gun rights, and freedom from taxes correlated weakly and in some cases negatively. 
  I attempted a weighting of the various freedom indices to take all my analysis 
  into account, and determined that I would rather move to Finland than North 
  Korea.
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have had some discussions on-line about libertarianism. Libertarians are 
  very sure that logic and reason are on their side and that life will be better 
  if government just gets out of the way and lets private enterprise take care 
  of everything. I'm not very ideological about who provides services in society 
  as long as it works well. I do have concerns about any system that places far 
  more value on one aspect of society (in this case, freedom) than on all the 
  other things we value. Other one-directional systems have not worked very well 
  in practice, however nice they might sound on paper. 
<p>Unfortunately, the libertarians I have asked can't point to a country where 
  their system has been tested out in real life. I can't look at the most libertarian 
  country and poke around at what life is like there and decide if it's a good 
  place to live, because no one can identify such a country. I don't believe in 
  selecting a political system based on its theory - I live in Canada, which has 
  been described as a country that "works in practice, but not in theory." I want 
  to know how it will work, because otherwise it's like buying a pig in a poke. 
<h2>What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>There are some websites that attach numbers to freedom indices for different 
  countries, so I can look at various kinds of freedom: business freedoms, freedom 
  of speech, tax freedom, property rights, etc. I thought if I could match those 
  various rating numbers against other national statistics, such as life expectancy 
  or average income, I might be able to pick out some trends. </p>
<p>In general, I'll break my discussion of results into three categories: life, 
  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Under life, for example, I could look 
  for a correlation between life expectancy in a country and its freedom of speech 
  index. If I saw a statistically valid correlation with a positive slope, that 
  would tell me that the average country with more freedom of speech has longer 
  average life expectancy. There are a couple of general caveats:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No causality is implied. From these statistics I cannot make any claim about 
    whether more freedom of speech results in longer life expectancy or whether 
    longer life expectancy results in more freedom of speech. I can only say whether 
    or not there is a correlation. </li>
  <li>I did not use time series data. These are just recent snapshots of each 
    country. That means I cannot make any claims about a change in freedom of 
    speech in a given country likely being accompanied by a corresponding change 
    in life expectancy. </li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a positive, statistically valid correlation, however, I can say 
  that if you move from your country to one with a higher score on the freedom 
  of speech index, you will most likely be moving to a country with longer average 
  life expectancy. </p>
<h2>The Freedom Indices</h2>
<p>I went looking for a source of numerical values for several freedom indices 
  for many countries that I could easily download into Excel. I also wanted the 
  source to be an organization that appeared to be libertarian in nature. I wanted 
  to investigate their claims, so I thought it would be good to use a source in 
  which they would have confidence. I think I found such a source at FreeExistence.org, 
  on this page: <A HREF="http://www.freeexistence.org/freedom.shtml">http://www.freeexistence.org/freedom.shtml</A>. FreeExistence.org 
  provides number ratings between 0 and 100 for the following nine indices: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Property rights </li>
  <li>Drug rights </li>
  <li>Freedom from taxes </li>
  <li>Freedom from corruption </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression </li>
  <li>Freedom from inflation </li>
  <li>Limited government </li>
  <li>Business freedom </li>
  <li>Gun rights </li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the one that made me really curious was the Index of Limited Government. 
  The creator of the FreeExistence website had no information on where that index 
  came from, and there is no email address on the site for posing questions. If 
  you read further, you'll see that this index gives very different results from 
  most of the other ones, so it became important to figure out what it was based 
  on. I recently downloaded country-by-country data on government spending as 
  a percentage of GDP and compared it against this Index of Limited Government. 
  Plotting them against each other, I got a curve so nearly perfect that it is 
  clear to me that's what this index is. The formula is:</p>
<p>Freedom Index = 99.645 + 0.0237 x (Govt Spending %) - 0.0303 x (Govt Spending 
  %)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The R squared value of this correlation is 0.9998. That qualifies as a slam 
  dunk in my books. This makes it possible to plot the other statistics I was 
  interested in against the government spending percentage itself, rather than 
  against the Index of Limited Government. I think that makes it more meaningful. 
  I will add notes [in square brackets] to that effect in each of the discussions 
  below.</p>
<h2>The Rest of the Data</h2>
<p>For the other statistics I was interested in, I mostly downloaded data from 
  Wikipedia. These are not necessarily the highest quality sources of data, but 
  this is just a curiosity project, not an academic study. If someone wants to 
  do a more rigorous analysis, that would be good. If someone has already done 
  a better analysis of this sort, I would be interested in seeing how their results 
  differ from mine.</p>
<h2>The Results: Life</h2>
<p>In the life category, I looked at infant mortality, life expectancy, murder 
  rates, and suicide rates. I consider lower infant mortality, longer life expectancy, 
  lower murder rates, and lower suicide rates to be the desirable direction. </p>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and infant 
  mortality. These are in descending order of the strength of the correlation. 
  On average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Property rights has 5.9 fewer infant deaths per 1000 live births, with 99% 
    confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom from corruption has 5.8 fewer infant deaths per 1000 live births, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression has 4.5 fewer infant deaths per 1000 live births, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Business freedom has 4.6 fewer infant deaths per 1000 live births, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Drug rights has 6.3 fewer infant deaths per 1000 live births, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Limited government has 2.5 <b>more</b> infant deaths per 1000 live births, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>[A country where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP has 3.9 
    fewer infant deaths per 1000 live births, with 99% confidence that this is 
    a statistically valid correlation.]</li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    infant mortality. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and life 
  expectancy. These are in descending order of the strength of the correlation. 
  On average, in a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Property rights, people live an average of 2.5 years longer, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom from corruption, people live an average of 2.5 years longer, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Business freedom, people live an average of 2.5 years longer, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression, people live an average of 1.4 years longer, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression, people live an average of 1.7 years longer, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Drug rights, people live an average of 1.9 years longer, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Limited government, people live an average of 0.7 years <b>less</b>, with 
    98% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>[In a country where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP, people 
    live an average of 2.3 years longer, with 99% confidence that this is a statistically 
    valid correlation.]</li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    life expectancy. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and murder 
  rates. These are in descending order of the strength of the correlation. On 
  average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Freedom from corruption has 3.1 fewer murders per 100,000 people, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Property rights has 2.4 fewer murders per 100,000 people, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Limited government has 2.0 <b>more</b> murders per 100,000 people, with 
    95% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>[A country where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP has 4.4 
    fewer murders per 100,000 population, with 95% confidence that this is a statistically 
    valid correlation.]</li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    murder rates. I found it interesting that the index with the weakest correlation 
    to murder rates of the nine was gun rights. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and suicide 
  rates. These are in descending order of the strength of the correlation. On 
  average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Freedom from corruption has 0.9 <b>more</b> suicides per 100,000 people, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Property rights has 0.8 <b>more</b> suicides per 100,000 people, with 99% 
    confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Business freedom has 0.8 <b>more</b> suicides per 100,000 people, with 95% 
    confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Limited government has 0.6 fewer suicides per 100,000 people, with 95% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>[A country where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP has 2.0 
    more suicides per 100,000 population, with 99% confidence that this is a statistically 
    valid correlation.]</li>
  <li>Freedom from inflation has 1.0 <b>more</b> suicides per 100,000 people, 
    with 90% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    suicide rates. Again, I found it interesting that the index with the weakest 
    correlation to suicide rates of the nine was gun rights. </li>
</ul>
<p>For most of the freedom indices, if you move to a country with a higher freedom 
  index, you will be moving to a country with lower infant mortality, longer life 
  expectancy, lower murder rates, and higher suicide rates. The one exception 
  is the index of limited government. If you move to a country with a higher score 
  on the limited government index [i.e., where government spending is a lower 
  percentage of GDP], you will on average be moving to a place with higher infant 
  mortality, lower life expectancy, higher murder rates, and lower suicide rates. 
</p>
<h2>The Results: Liberty</h2>
<p>In the liberty category, I mainly looked at cross-tabulations between the nine 
  freedom indices. In addition, I looked at incarceration rates. </p>
<p>The cross-tabulations between the freedom indices showed that most of them 
  are positively correlated with each other, some of them very strongly. A few 
  pairs of indices have no statistically significant correlation, and one pair, 
  limited government and freedom of expression, are negatively correlated. The 
  following table shows the relationships between the nine indices. In this chart, 
  a cell indicates the average number of points the index at the left will change 
  if the index at the top increases by 10. For example, if one country's freedom 
  from corruption is 10 points higher than another country's, the first country's 
  property rights index will on average be 9.6 points higher. If a country's limited 
  government index is 10 points higher, its freedom of expression index will on 
  average be 1.8 points lower. </p>

</table>
<p>The table is arranged so that the indices with the strongest correlations to 
  the other eight are generally found towards the top left and the ones that correlate 
  the most weakly are generally to the bottom right. If the number in the table 
  is black, the correlation is statistically significant with at least 99% confidence. 
  If the number is green, the correlation is statistically significant with at 
  least 95% confidence. If the number is purple, the correlation is statistically 
  significant with at least 90% confidence. Red is used to show a negative correlation 
  - in both cases these are statistically significant with confidence of at least 
  99%. If the cell is empty, there is no statistically significant correlation. 
  Cells on the diagonal are blanked out, because an index's correlation with itself 
  is trivial. [I didn't look at the relationship between government spending as 
  a percentage of GDP and these other indices, because I was primarily interested 
  in how they relate to each other.]</p>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and incarceration 
  rates. On average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of business 
  freedom has 7.7 <b>more</b> prisoners per 100,000 people, with 95% confidence 
  that this is a statistically valid correlation. None of the other freedom indices 
  had statistically valid correlations with incarceration rates [including government 
  spending]. </p>
<p>It appears that incarceration rate is not very indicative of the influence 
  of these indices of freedom on "liberty" since it has only a weak correlation 
  with just one of the indices. The correlations between the indices seem more 
  useful. Based on the table above, the business freedom index seems to be the 
  best "bellwether" indicating whether a country is likely to score well on the 
  indices of the other freedoms. Gun rights seems to be the least predictive, 
  having weak or no correlation with half of the other indices. </p>
<h2>The Results: The Pursuit of Happiness</h2>
<p>I wasn't sure how best to define the pursuit of happiness. There is a Global 
  Barometer of Happiness, based on interviews of nearly 53,000 people in 58 countries 
  by Leger Marketing. As mentioned below, I found only weak correlations with 
  two of the indices of freedom and no statistically significant correlation with 
  any of the others. Moreover, happiness is not the same as the pursuit of happiness. 
  I'm not sure quite what is required to pursue happiness, but I looked at some 
  things that might influence people's ability to go after the things they want: 
  average income (based on purchasing power parity), income inequality (the Gini 
  coefficient), and the Human Development Index, which is a composite of life 
  expectancy, literacy, education and standards of living. </p>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and the Global 
  Barometer of Happiness. These are in descending order of the strength of the 
  correlation. On average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Property rights scores 1.7 points higher on the Global Barometer of Happiness, 
    with 90% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Business freedom scores 2.3 points higher on the Global Barometer of Happiness, 
    with 90% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    the Global Barometer of Happiness. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and per capita 
  income (based on purchasing power parity). These are in descending order of 
  the strength of the correlation. On average, in a country scoring 10 points 
  higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Freedom from corruption, people have average incomes $5,100 higher, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Property rights, people have average incomes $4,200 higher, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Business freedom, people have average incomes $3,100 higher, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression, people have average incomes $1,900 higher, with 99% 
    confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Drug rights, people have average incomes $2,600 higher, with 99% confidence 
    that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Limited government, people have average incomes $1,300 <b>lower</b>, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>[In acountry where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP, people 
    have average incomes $2,100 higher, with 99% confidence that this is a statistically 
    valid correlation.]</li>
  <li>Freedom from inflation, people have average incomes $1,400 higher, with 
    95% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    average income. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and income 
  inequality (based on the Gini coefficient). A higher Gini coefficient would 
  indicate that the wealthy have incomes farther above the average income than 
  in other countries. A lower Gini coefficient would indicate that the poor are 
  not as far below the average income as in other countries. Thus, it is less 
  a measure of the overall ability to pursue happiness within a society as it 
  is a measure of who can pursue happiness within the society more easily. The 
  relationships below are in descending order of the strength of the correlation. 
  On average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Limited government would score 1.7 points higher on the Gini index, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>[A country where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP would 
    score 2.3 points lower on the Gini index, with 99% confidence that this is 
    a statistically valid correlation.]</li>
  <li>Freedom from corruption would score 1.3 points lower on the Gini index, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Property rights would score 1.1 points lower on the Gini index, with 99% 
    confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom from taxes would score 1.3 points higher on the Gini index, with 
    98% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Business freedom would score 1.0 points lower on the Gini index, with 98% 
    confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    average income. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I found for correlations between the freedom indices and the Human 
  Development Index. These are in descending order of the strength of the correlation. 
  On average, a country scoring 10 points higher on the index of: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Property rights scores 4.1 points higher on the Human Development Index, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom from corruption scores 4.3 points higher on the Human Development 
    Index, with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation 
  </li>
  <li>Business freedom scores 3.6 points higher on the Human Development Index, 
    with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression scores 2.9 points higher on the Human Development 
    Index, with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation 
  </li>
  <li>Limited government scores 2.1 points <b>lower</b> on the Human Development 
    Index, with 99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation 
  </li>
  <li>[A country where government spending is a 10% larger share of GDP scores 
    2.9 points higher on the Human Development Index, with 99% confidence that 
    this is a statistically valid correlation.] </li>
  <li>Drug rights scores 4.2 points higher on the Human Development Index, with 
    99% confidence that this is a statistically valid correlation </li>
  <li>The remaining indices do not have statistically valid correlations with 
    average income. </li>
</ul>
<p>For most of the freedom indices, they have little or no statistically valid 
  correlation to the Barometer of Happiness, but they do have correlations with 
  the other three values under pursuit of happiness. If you move to a country 
  with a higher freedom index, you will be moving to a country with higher average 
  income and a higher score on the Human Development Index. The exception to this 
  is limited government. If you move to a country with a higher score on the limited 
  government index [i.e., where government spending is a lower percentage of GDP], 
  you will on average move to a country with lower average income and a lower 
  Human Development score. The Gini index is positively correlated with some indices 
  (limited government and tax freedom) and negatively correlated with others (freedom 
  from corruption, property rights, and business freedom). </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Most of the indices of freedom correlate positively with a society's ability 
  to foster life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, based on the national 
  statistics I examined. The exceptions are: the index of limited government, 
  which appears to be correlated with decreasing ability to protect both life 
  and the pursuit of happiness; and freedom from taxes and gun rights, which are 
  both apparently correlated with a decreasing ability to protect the pursuit 
  of happiness. Shuffling all these correlations together is a fairly arbitrary 
  process, very dependent on your personal values. I have made an attempt, combining 
  the strength (r value) of the correlations in each category and then weighting 
  each of the three categories equally. In order from most to least positively 
  correlated with these three categories, the nine indices fall in the following 
  order: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Property rights </li>
  <li>Freedom from corruption </li>
  <li>Business freedom </li>
  <li>Freedom from inflation </li>
  <li>Freedom of expression </li>
  <li>Drug rights </li>
  <li>Freedom from taxes </li>
  <li>Gun rights </li>
  <li>Limited government </li>
</ul>
<p>If I weight the nine indices according to this pattern and rank countries according 
  to a composite index of freedom, the top 10 countries in the dataset are as 
  follows: Finland, New Zealand, Denmark, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Sweden, 
  Germany, Iceland, and Ireland. The next 10 are mainly in Western Europe, with 
  the exception of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Barbados. The United States places 
  21st. The bottom countries include quite a few for which the indices are not 
  available due to lack of data. The bottom five are: North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, 
  Afghanistan, and Iraq. If we exclude countries for which various indices are 
  missing, the bottom five are: Burma, Eritrea, Libya, Turkmenistan, and Democratic 
  Republic of Congo. </p>
<h2>A Few Notes on the Statistical Analysis</h2>
<p>I am not a professional statistician, though I use statistics in my work. I 
  did this analysis in Excel, because (as my friends will attest) I use Excel 
  for all kinds of things from tracking my investments to timing the cooking of 
  a ham. I would be interested in seeing this analysis done more rigorously by 
  someone who really knows what they're doing. </p>
<p>To obtain my correlations, I plotted the indices of freedom against the other 
  statistics in Excel and let Excel's built-in regression system find the best 
  linear equation and calculate the r-squared value. In many cases, a different 
  shape of curve might have offered a higher r-squared value than a straight line, 
  but I wanted to keep things simple so I didn't pursue that. To test the statistical 
  validity of an r value, I used a table from the appendix of <i>Statistical Methods, 
  Seventh Edition</i>, 1980, by George Snedecor & William Cochrane. The table 
  was originally from <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i>, 1925, by 
  R.A. Fisher. 1925! We stand on the shoulders of giants. </p>
<p>If I wanted to push this analysis further, Snedecor & Cochrane describe how 
  to estimate the expected distribution of the y-variable for a given value of 
  x in a correlation like this. That would enable me to, for example, estimate 
  the variance for the life expectancy in countries with a freedom of expression 
  index value of 60. In theory, then, if you lived in a country whose freedom 
  of expression index was 50, you could estimate the odds that average life expectancy 
  would increase if you moved to one with an index of 60. It seemed like too much 
  work, so I didn't go there. </p>
<p>The major thing missing from this analysis is time series data. I can talk 
  about how countries compare with each other, but I can't talk about how a given 
  country changes with time. In five years, presumably many of the freedom indices 
  and many of the other statistics will change. At that point, just as an example, 
  I could plot change in life expectancy versus change in the index of freedom 
  of expression. That would permit a discussion of what societal changes tend 
  to go together and which ones go in opposite directions. </p>
