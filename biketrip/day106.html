  Day 106: Monday, 3 September, 1984
</H1>
<P>
[Got up brutally early and caught my 6:30 a.m. plane home to Ottawa. Returned
in time to vote, but Mulroney got elected anyway.]
<P>
[I had really mixed feelings about the whole thing being over. It was tough
going back to normal life as a third-year engineering student at University
of Waterloo. On the other hand, I was kind of tired of moving on every day,
almost always interacting with strangers, saying goodbye to new friends as
fast as I made them, and especially of being self-sufficient.]
<P>
[My bike, Gerald, was pretty tired, too. When I finally took him apart to
fix a few things back up, and figure out what that noise from the back wheel
had been for the last two days in Newfoundland, I found that the back axle
was broken. It had snapped just to the inside of one of the cones, and the
only thing holding it together was the quick-release spindle. It was enough.]
<P>
[So that's the story of my bike trip across Canada. Thanks for reading it
all.]
