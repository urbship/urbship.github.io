  Day 94: Wednesday, 22 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up, had a quick breakfast, and blasted down to the ferry terminal.
I made it with over ten minutes to spare. Had a very relaxing trip across.
<P>
I rode out of Digby and down the coast towards Annapolis Royal. Took a short
cut at one point (down an eight-foot cliff!) Soon I got to the tidal power
exhibit. Spent some time there--pretty interesting.
<P>
Then I took off up Hwy 8. Climbed over the backbone of Nova Scotia. Not too
many people in this area.
<P>
Eventually I stopped and phoned Dad and Linda S. [another CUSOBOT]. The phone
didn't work--I reached the operator by pressing the hook switch. I rode on
till I found a little picnic place and stopped there.
