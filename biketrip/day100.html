  Day 100: Tuesday, 28 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I was up rather early this morning, but I didn't actually get going till
11 a.m. or so.
<P>
Started off along the Trans-Canada. After about 15 km I met Kevin C. [housemate
from Waterloo, then on a bike trip in Cape Breton] and his group. Had a chat
with them. We headed off on our separate ways.
<P>
I had a flat later on. Felt like going for a swim in the Bras D'Or Lake,
but I didn't. I had a second flat instead.
<P>
Turned off the Trans-Canada onto a road that crossed a couple of ferries
and followed the railway fairly closely. So it was a fairly easy ride to
North Sydney. Phoned some people (whose name I got from Linda S. in Halifax)
and camped in their backyard.
