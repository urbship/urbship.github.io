  Day 51: Tuesday, 10 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I awoke before 8 and had a shower. Had breakfast and packed up and headed
out. Just as I was leaving I met two cyclists. Talked to them briefly, but
when we all took off they dropped behind.
<P>
I rode to Bruce Mines and had an omelette. Then carried on. Rode through
all these places till I came to Blind River.
<P>
On that road if I went off the pavement the loose gravel was very difficult
to stay up in. I did actually drop the bike once. Fortunately, no one was
behind me. Also had to fight through a bit of construction.
<P>
After Blind River I rode to just past Spanish. Then I had to ride way up
into the hills on a gravel road to find the night's campground. Very nice,
but too much work.
