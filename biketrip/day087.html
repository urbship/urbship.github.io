  Day 87: Wednesday, 15 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up and had a shower and then had a good breakfast with the D.s [the
kind, but inadequately briefed parents of my Dad's friend in Ottawa]. I got
packed up slowly. Had to fix my stupid radio--the antenna fell off. Anyway,
I said goodbye to everyone and set off.
<P>
I rode to Montague and bought groceries and talked to the
<CITE>Graphic</CITE>. It's supposed to be one of the best newspapers in Canada.
<P>
I carried on to the ferry. Ate lunch on the ferry. It didn't seem to take
long to get across.
<P>
I didn't go all that far on the Nova Scotia side. Camped at Lyons Brook.
I listened to the leaders debate on women's issues on the radio after supper.
Interesting. [You may have figured out by now that there was a Canadian election
going on at the time I was riding.]
