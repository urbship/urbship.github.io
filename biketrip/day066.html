  Day 66: Wednesday, 25 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Took off quite late this morning, after a shower, a leisurely breakfast,
and some catching up in the diary.
<P>
Rode off, mostly downhill, but against a wind a bit. It wasn't too hot, anyway.
I plowed along till I was almost to Carleton Place and then called Dad to
let him know I was on my way in.
<P>
Stopped at Carleton Place to try and find Bob M. [mechanical engineering
classmate], but he works in Ottawa now. So I carried on, taking a few shots
of wildflowers along the way.
<P>
Met Jill [my sister] and Dad at Eagleson and Queensway. We came in mainly
on bike paths. Got home and had hamburgers for supper.
<P>
Popped over to P.s' [friends] to see the new baby, etc. Came back and showed
slides. Then took Jill home to her new apartment.
