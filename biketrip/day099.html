  Day 99: Monday, 27 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Slept in until about 9:30 a.m. Got up and had breakfast and slowly packed
up. Rode off down the road. I called Antigonish and let them know I was coming.
<P>
Then I rode into Antigonish, to the Coady Institute. Talked to people there
for a while. Their public relations person got some info from me for the
local media.
<P>
I got groceries and left town. Rode along the Trans-Canada towards the Strait
of Canso. This area is a little short of campgrounds, but I eventually found
one after the Strait. As I was getting supper the people next to me offered
their Coleman lantern and a beer. That made things a lot easier.
