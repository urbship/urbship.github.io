  Day 34: Saturday, 23 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Wedding day at the S. house! Lots of work to be done and I joined in quite
happily.
<P>
It was early afternoon when people began to arrive. I got dressed in the
best finery I could manage. It rained just a tad right at the beginning,
but then stopped and the service got going.
<P>
I was impressed with the choice of reading and with the fairly fiery minister.
He talked about the upheaval in Chile that had brought the groom and his
family to Canada.
<P>
Lots and lots of food afterward. I talked to lots of people who were interested
in what I'm doing. Even got a few pledges. The party thinned out fairly early
and ended around midnight.
