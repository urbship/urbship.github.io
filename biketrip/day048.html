  Day 48: Saturday, 7 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Slept in till 9 or so. After breakfast I met a couple of other cyclists.
They started in Winnipeg and are going to the East Coast. One of them wants
to be in Waterloo at the same time as I do.
<P>
Anyway, I left and rode off down the road. Listened to the radio as I rode.
I kept hearing a call for people to join a search for a guy out in the bush.
<P>
I got to that area and saw a bunch of guys drinking beer. They waved one
at me so I stopped. Turns out they found the guy.
<P>
I rode on. Ate in a restaurant in White River. Met some of the searchers
again.
<P>
Then headed south. Was given another beer just before Obatanga Park. Either
the map and road signs are funny or my odometer is wrong today.
