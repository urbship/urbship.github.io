  Day 27: Saturday, 16 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I slept in again. Reread "San Diego Lightfoot Sue." The female lead in that
short story remains the only fictional character I've ever fallen in love
with. Tom Reamy's best work.
<P>
After that I had breakfast and started packing up. Got into a long conversation
with Blair and Linda [his sister] and stayed and stayed. We eventually went
to Joe's Cycles and bought a new pump. Came home and fixed my front tire.
<P>
Finally was ready to leave. Felt again a certain reluctance to leave good
surroundings and people. Got as far as Safeway's, where I bought food. There
I met Erwin H. [Katja's dad] and we chatted.
<P>
Rode off to a campsite or picnic site actually and stopped there. Two guys
pulled in next to me so we drank beer and told jokes for a few hours.
