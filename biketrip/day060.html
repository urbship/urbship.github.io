  Day 60: Thursday, 19 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at the same time as Tannis and her boyfriend. They were going off
to the University, so I left, too--at 8:15.
<P>
I rode pretty steadily and soon was in Toronto. Rolled in on Weston Road.
It was all right.
<P>
Bob W. [friend from Botswana], etc., were not there, so I went to the CUSO
office. I left my stuff there and went off sightseeing. Went up the CN Tower.
What a tourist trap that is!
<P>
Went back and picked up my stuff and went over to Benny and Bob's. No one
was there, so after a while I called up Nigel O. (a CUSO person) and he came
and picked me up.
<P>
Went out for supper with them (Nigel and his wife) and then crashed there,
because it was more difficult to go over to Bob's again.
