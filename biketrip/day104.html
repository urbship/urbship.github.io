  Day 104: Saturday, 1 September, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up this morning when Linda R. arrived to pay for the room. She took me
out to breakfast and then dropped me off at Mary Jane's Health Food. I made
some phone calls to radio stations and talked to Lance B.--a Project Ploughshares
guy.
<P>
I went back to my hotel and then wandered up to Canary Cycles. Talked to
the owner there for a while. He's in the cycling club. Then went back to
Mary Jane's.
<P>
I changed my airline ticket to Monday (6:30 a.m!) Went to Lance's place for
a while. He offered me his neighbor's place for Sunday night. We went to
Signal Hill, followed by a restaurant and two bars, where we met all kinds
of people.
