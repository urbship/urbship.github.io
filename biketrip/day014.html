  Day 14: Sunday, 3 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up and had breakfast with my newfound friends. Packed up and left around
9:45 or so. About 15 km down the road I decided to try to find my traveller's
cheques. Couldn't find them.
<P>
So I hitched a ride back to Revelstoke and left a note. Rode out again.
Eventually stopped to put on a sweater and did another search and found the
damn cheques. Frustrating. So I carried on.
<P>
Called Dad from the summit of Roger's Pass at 5 p.m. It was an easy pass,
actually. Pressing on to Golden was hard, though. By the time I got to Golden
I felt like I was pushing my outer limits of endurance.
<P>
Stopped at a restaurant for supper. Then went to a KOA [campground] at the
top of the hill out of town and sacked out.
