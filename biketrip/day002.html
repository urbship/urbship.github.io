  Day 2: Tuesday, 22 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up in good time and went to town (unloaded) after a good breakfast. I
couldn't find the CUSO staff person, but I saw the provincial museum (top
notch) and had a Roger's Chocolate. Amazing thing.
<P>
I returned to Auntie Jessie and Uncle Bob's, had lunch, and packed up. Decided
to skip Malahat Mountain and take the Mill Bay ferry instead. So I had a
lovely ride to the ferry and made it with ten minutes to spare.
<P>
From the ferry I rode straight to Nanaimo almost non-stop. A bit wet in spots,
but I expected that. I felt tired and very hungry by the end of it. It was
really nice to pull up at the Doug and Sue C.'s house [former CUSO Botswana
volunteers when our family was there]. Have had a good visit with them so
far.
