  Day 98: Sunday, 26 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up about 8 a.m. and started packing up and eating, etc. Three cyclists
headed up the road before me.
<P>
I rode at my normal pace, stopping for a snack now and then. I eventually
caught up to these guys and then rode with them. They are going to have a
bit of trouble because they all ride at different speeds. One guy was basically
my speed, but one was really slow.
<P>
I had a swim in the Atlantic today. It wasn't all that cold. The second warmest
ocean I've been in [after the Indian--the Arctic was the coldest!]
<P>
I left the three guys a while after that and rode on until Sherbrooke. Had
supper there and then went to a campsite where I drank Screech with some
neighbors.
