  Day 58: Tuesday, 17 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Woke up fairly early. Was at the credit union waiting for it to open, because
it didn't open till 10 a.m. I got through there as soon as I could.
<P>
Bought a tire and then showed up at the Gazette. Had a good interview with
a woman there and then the Imprint called and I rushed over there and did
an interview with its editor. I talked to Rich C. [a CUSOBOT] after that
and then went to Project Ploughshares.
<P>
Eventually got home. Kevin and I went to the University and worked on an
IBM for a while, so I could learn the word processor.
<P>
After supper I showed my slides--great exposure! The went back and typed
Kevin's report till about 1 a.m. We hit the sack around 2.
