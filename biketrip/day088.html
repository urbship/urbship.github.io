  Day 88: Thursday, 16 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had breakfast, etc., and took off. I rode towards Truro. There
was a bit of a hump to climb over between there. I eventually got to go downhill
for a while, though. The wind was also against me. The weatherman says the
wind will change tomorrow.
<P>
I rode into Truro and found the newspaper by accident. After talking to them
I went to the radio station. They didn't have time. I bought food and took
off.
<P>
I rode along on some nice small roads. Got dumped on by a heavy rain for
a while. I couldn't find the campground that was on the map, so I set up
by the road.
