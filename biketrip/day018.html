  Day 18: Thursday, 7 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got a late start today. Rode to Hinton, facing a slight easterly.
<P>
When I got there I went to the newspaper office and got interviewed and
photographed. Then I called Boyd M. at CUSO and got good news about the media,
etc., for the next few major centres.
<P>
Continued on in the rain and against the wind (and uphill for a while). Made
it to Edson where my nose led me to a Kentucky Fried Chicken (I had a craving
for the stuff).
<P>
Then I intended to ride 32 km to a campground. It wasn't there. Continued
to a farm where the lights were on. Asked permission from a lady to pitch
a tent. She said yes, but then a guy came out and told me to leave ten minutes
later. So I rode on another 16 km and found a campground at midnight.
