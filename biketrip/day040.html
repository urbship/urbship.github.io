  Day 40: Friday, 29 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up fairly early and went downtown to meet Katharine C. We had a long
talk, walking around downtown Winnipeg.
<P>
Then returned to Nanoo's place. My handlebar bag collapsed on the way, but
I was able to buy a new support for it at a store on Portage Avenue.
<P>
Fixed my tires and packed up and visited with Nanoo. It has been a good visit,
although a bit short, as are most of my visits this trip.
<P>
I eventually took off for the East. Rode to Beausejour and found a stupid
campground. Hardly anything here. Toilets don't flush. Water not drinkable.
Stupid. My tire has a bump, too.
