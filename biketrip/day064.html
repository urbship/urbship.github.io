  Day 64: Monday, 23 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had a shower and sort of ate a bit of breakfast (hadn't really
got breakfast supplies yet). Packed up, still under the supervision of the
curious boy and his sister.
<P>
I rode off and plugged away pretty steadily. I had something of a wind behind
me so I did quite well. Got to Peterborough around 4:30.
<P>
I found one radio station and the newspaper and then went down to the NDP
office. From there I phoned another radio station.
<P>
Bought groceries on the way out and then rode about 40 km to a campsite in
Blairton. Had pork chops for supper.
