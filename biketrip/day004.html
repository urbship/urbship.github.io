  Day 4: Thursday, 24 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Well, that was a longer day than I bargained for, or at least it felt like
it. I got up at twenty to eight and had breakfast and then relaxed until
eleven or so. Then I hopped on my bike and took off.
<P>
My knees felt lousy all day today. Had to stand up for some hills and used
lower gears than normal all day. I also developed a creak in the bottom bracket.
However, I made it to Long Beach and at the moment I'm sitting on a driftwood
log watching the sunset.

That's one good thing about today--I saw the sun a lot. Bad thing: the boat
isn't going back to Port Alberni.
