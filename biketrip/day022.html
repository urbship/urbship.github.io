  Day 22: Monday, 11 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 8, but didn't leave till 11:30 or so. I was ambling along, not
going very fast. Eventually ran into a bunch of oil on the cracks in the
road. I don't know what this does for the road, but it made my tires so sticky
that they picked up glass and I got a flat.
<P>
I scraped the goo off for over an hour. Yuck. So I rode on into Bonnyville
to buy supper, etc. Got into so many conversations that it took more than
an hour.
<P>
A little rain in the evening. I rode till really late because of all my delays.
It was a bit hard to find Cold Lake Provincial Park with the directions I
got. So I didn't bother with supper; just went to bed.
