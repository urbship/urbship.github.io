  Day 75: Friday, 3 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up a little late, had breakfast and packed up, said goodbye to various
new friends at the hostel (I'm sure glad I'm not overly shy) and headed out.
<P>
Moseyed along as far as Beaupre without much difficulty. Then there's a mammoth
hill and another one and another one. Kept climbing for a few hours and
eventually got to a sign that said 7 to 10% downgrades for 20 km. Well, it
wasn't solidly downhill, but it was fun.
<P>
Eventually got to Baie-St.-Paul and bought a few groceries. Then an incredible
(gravel) hill to the hostel. I got halfway and then two guys helped me push
Gerald.
<P>
Bought supper and camped here. The view is one of the best I've ever seen.
