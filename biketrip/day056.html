  Day 56: Sunday, 15 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Had to get up at 8 a.m. again, due to the tent warming up. Had a leisurely
breakfast and gradually started packing up. I waited for Kevin to get there
before I packed up the last part. Then said goodbye to everyone and we rode
away.
<P>
Went into town pretty quickly. We arrived at Waterloo Park (with Kevin C.
[a housemate from university], who came out to meet us part way), and began
looking around for Susan I. [the local CUSO rep.]
<P>
Eventually found her. Talked to the media and to Walter Maclean, M.P., and
a city councilman, etc.
<P>
Then came back to Kevin's place, had a shower and went out for supper. Szechuan.
Pretty good. Returned, watched some telly, made a couple of phone calls,
and hit the hay.
