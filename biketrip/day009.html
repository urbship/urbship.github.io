  Day 9: Tuesday, 29 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had breakfast and got on the road about eleven. A bit late. The
road meandered a bit before I got hooked up with highway seven again. I stayed
on that until Hope.
<P>
Around one I got through to CUSO and talked to Boyd M. [then fundraising
director of CUSO]. Had lunch around three and another cyclist stopped to
chat. He's going to Edmonton.
<P>
I got groceries in Hope and started up highway three. I don't expect snow.
<P>
I'm camped at Nicolum River. Pretty nice. I sort of have a fire going, but
I think I'd better cook on my stove.
