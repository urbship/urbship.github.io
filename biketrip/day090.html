  Day 90: Saturday, 18 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Well, I got up 8:30ish and had breakfast with the T.s. At about 10 o'clock
a few people came over and we sat on the balcony and talked, about my trip
and other things. At 11:30 we popped down to the post office and I got
photographed. Went back and had lunch and then I was ready to take off.
<P>
I didn't travel overly fast today, but it was mostly easy riding through
the Annapolis Valley. I met a couple of cyclists from Vermont.
<P>
There's reportedly a Ploughshares guy near here, but he wasn't home, so I
climbed the side of the valley near Bridgetown to a campground. Have to get
going early tomorrow to get the 12:30 Digby ferry.
