  Day 73: Wednesday, 1 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Crossed the bridge again, because I had heard that the south side of the
river was nicer. It was pretty nice, all right. There was one church that
was pretty impressive.
<P>
I stopped for tourist info and it was the same woman as yesterday (!?!) Nice
person, too.
<P>
Anyway, I had to carry on. Rode pretty steadily, with a stop or two for ice
cream.
<P>
Soon I was at Levis. I plunged down the hill to the ferry, braking hard.
Got on and crossed to Quebec and then had an incredible climb. Stood on the
pedals in first gear, but I made it.
<P>
Found space at one youth hostel. Met two other cyclists. Went out for Greek
food and then back to the hostel and to bed early.
