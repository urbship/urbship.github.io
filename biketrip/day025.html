  Day 25: Thursday, 14 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I slept in a tad today. Got up, had a bath, and then breakfast. Then I got
packed and went out to meet the press.
<P>
I talked to the North Battleford New Optimist and the Battleford Telegraph.
That made me so late leaving that I didn't get on the road till 11:45. So
I had to pedal like mad. Just stopped a couple of times for quick snacks.
<P>
Met Gary B. [friend in Saskatoon] at Borden Bridge. That was a boost. He
rode in with me, the CFQC-TV camera crew pacing us for a while.
<P>
Rodney C. [another Saskatoon friend] met us and then after a while we met
the Saskatoon Cycling Club, who escorted me to Knox Church.
<P>
There was a nice reception, an interview by CKOM Radio and a TV10 (PBS)
interview. Then supper in a restaurant at CUSO expense. Then to Blair P.'s
to crash.
