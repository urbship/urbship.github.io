  Day 42: Sunday, 1 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had a swim. Finished off the fried rice from last night. Then
packed up and rode off.
<P>
Roads were pretty rough through the rest of the park. Once I got onto Hwy
1 it was pretty smooth riding, but it was also pretty busy. At least there
were shoulders in most places.
<P>
Bought groceries in Kenora. Wanted a book, since I finished <CITE>The
Covenant</CITE>. I eventually managed to buy a copy of <CITE>Newsweek</CITE>
close to the junction of Hwy 71.
<P>
Then I turned south towards Fort Frances. Carried on about 50 km to Sioux
Narrows Provincial Park. Rolled in pretty late, but I actually found a place.
<P>
Set up camp and ate supper. Lots of fireflies over the marsh that stretches
out from the cliff at the back of my site.
