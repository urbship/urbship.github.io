  Day 31: Wednesday, 20 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Slept in till about ten today. Had some pork chops this morning. Really good.
I should do that more often.
<P>
I was pretty late leaving and felt pretty lazy. I was against the wind all
the way to Roblin and I kept stopping to rest. I think I was a bit rundown
or something.
<P>
I had originally planned to go right to Dauphin, but I decided to stop just
short of Grandview. Still a 98.6 km day. Tomorrow will be about 120 I guess.
<P>
I was planning to phone Katja H. [friend from Saskatoon], but there was no
phone at the campground, as usual. I overate at supper. Didn't get rained
on, though.
