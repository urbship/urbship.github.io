  Day 36: Monday, 25 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Rose late and began to get set. I showered and had breakfast. Had lots of
food given to me by Aunt Joy (or whatever I'm supposed to call her). Packed
up and left after noon.
<P>
Rode into town and found Brian. He took lots of pictures and then we moseyed
over to the radio-TV station and did an interview. Said goodbye to Brian.
I got a real kick out of him.
<P>
Rode out of town towards Shilo. Eventually got onto a gravel road that went
south. Got a bit lost, but eventually found my way to the camp where Janet
is involved in an archeological dig.
<P>
Got a tour of the dig and after supper had a long talk with the head of the
project. Learned a lot. This is a Hudson Bay Co. House that they're digging
up.
