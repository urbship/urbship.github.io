  Day 49: Sunday, 8 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up late and packed up. Didn't get away till close to noon. Rode into
Wawa and went to tourist information. I asked the girl to point out a campground
100 km away and she said Pancake Bay. That is 100 <STRONG>miles</STRONG>
away, but I couldn't get anything else out of her.
<P>
Anyway, I went part way into town to get a few groceries. Then I phoned Kevin
[my brother] and talked to him for a while.
<P>
Then left for Lake Superior Provincial Park. I rode through that until late
in the evening and eventually reached a campground at the south end of it
that was about 100 km from Wawa. That will enable me to get past the Sault
tomorrow.
<P>
Roads were pretty empty today. Not much traffic on Sundays.
