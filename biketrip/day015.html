  Day 15: Monday, 4 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got off to a late start today. Rode part way up the pass and then stopped
at a viewpoint. There, eating lunch, were the people I met at Long Beach
a couple of weeks ago! So I had lunch with them.
<P>
Continued on up the pass, taking pictures (and my time). A train went through
the spiral tunnels when I was there.
<P>
Crossed the Great Divide and rode down to Lake Louise. From there I headed
north.
<P>
Had a flat, so I was really late getting to Mosquito Creek. Decided to stay
in the Youth Hostel here. It's only $4.50 a night. I'm rather pooped now.
