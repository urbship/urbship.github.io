  Day 1: Monday, 21 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Mom and Dad saw me off at the airport this morning. It was good to have at
least a short visit with them. They gave me a few addresses along the way,
too. First leg of the flight [from Ottawa, Ont., to Victoria, B.C.] was
quiet--then I talked to a guy beside me on the way from Calgary to Vancouver.
Scenery was very interesting from the window. Plane emptied out for the way
to Victoria.
<P>
I put my bike together in the airport and went to town. Got some info and
phoned Jessie and Bob S. (great aunt and uncle). After buying a few supplies
I went up to their house and had a good visit with them. So I didn't camp
on my first night here.
