  Day 65: Tuesday, 24 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had a swim and then breakfast. Packed up and got going at the
usual time--11 a.m. or so.
<P>
For the first time in many days, I actually stopped for lunch. There was
a beautiful picnic site where the Tweed road joins Hwy 7. I had lots of time
today, too.
<P>
Carried on in the afternoon. There was a bit of a wind against me, but no
big deal.
<P>
Got to the campground at Silver Lake around 6:30, after getting groceries
and gas [for my stove] at various places along the route. I had a swim when
I got set up. Then supper and it still wasn't dark. Went and watched some
movies and then hit the sack.
