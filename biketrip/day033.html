  Day 33: Friday, 22 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up late and took my time, doddling over breakfast. I had some porridge,
but my milk was sour, so it was unadorned.
<P>
I eventually moseyed off in the afternoon, sneaking out to the highway through
the back of the campsite (gasp!).
<P>
I had a nice ride as far as Minnedosa, but then I hit a big thunderstorm.
Got offered a lift to Brandon but I declined. It was raining so hard it brought
me and several cars to a halt.
<P>
However, I made it to Brandon and called for instructions. Brian S. [is the
son of my godparents my godbrother?] met me outside Brandon and we rode to
the S.' place. Great welcome. Food, help with the bike, etc.
