  Day 68: Friday, 27 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 9:30 when the radio station called. I did a taped interview, which
was okay. I was a little groggy, but that was okay.
<P>
Then I had a shower and slowly got going. Had a phone interview with the
<CITE>Citizen</CITE>. Then went out to lunch with Mark T. [an old friend]
and did an interview with CKCU radio.
<P>
Then talked to CFRA radio. That was good, because they have a huge listening
audience.
<P>
The photographer from the <CITE>Citizen</CITE> didn't show up. Made a date
with <CITE>Le Droit</CITE>, but that didn't work out.
<P>
So I had supper and we went out to a movie--Nanoo [my grandma], Mom, Dad,
and I. We saw <CITE>Pope of Greenwich Village</CITE>. Came home and did my
OSAP [Ontario Student Assistance Program] forms. Then packed up and went
to bed.
