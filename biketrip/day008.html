  Day 8: Monday, 28 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up eightish and saw Erik and his roommate leave for work. Did my laundry,
had a shower, and fixed up Gerald. Then I took off for lots of errands.
<P>
First I got some postcards and some directions at travel info. Then got my
picture put on my hostel card. Then got a water bottle. Then went to CUSO.
Very brief stop there. Then Ploughshares. That was really good. Much more
encouraging.
<P>
Then took off for the East, stopping for groceries on the way. I actually
didn't leave downtown Vancouver till four, but still put on 88 km. Quite
a day. Camping at Rollie Lake.
