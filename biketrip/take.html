  What I Took
</H1>
<P>
I managed to dig out my old packing list from the trip. &nbsp;What I actually
took diverged somewhat from the list, and I've tried to re-create the reality
from memory as well as I could. &nbsp;You'll see that I travelled fairly
heavy. &nbsp;For a shorter trip, I'd certainly take less, but with the prospect
of spending 3 1/2 months solo, living on a bike, I remember feeling that
I needed a few comforts. &nbsp;You'll also note that some of the items I
took have become kind of obsolete. &nbsp;Not many people will be using a
freewheel remover these days, for example. &nbsp;I'm sure you can adjust
for that, however.
<P>
Before I get into the list, I thought I'd give a couple of high points:
<UL>
  <LI>
    the award for most useless item has to go to the small axe. &nbsp;I probably
    used it twice for actually chopping wood. &nbsp;I never felt like making
    a fire to cook at the end of a 10-hour day of riding. &nbsp;It was much easier
    to just light the stove. I did use it to pound in tent pegs, but there are
    always rocks around for that. &nbsp;It weighs too much--leave it out.
  <LI>
    most miraculous packing choice would be the decision to bring four (not three
    and not five) spare rear hub bearings. On <A HREF="day093.html">Day 93</A>
    I had to dismantle my rear hub to deal with the horrendous noise it was making,
    and found that exactly four (not three and not five) of the bearings had
    crumbled.
  <LI>
    most used luxury item that most people wouldn't take: &nbsp;my short-wave
    radio. &nbsp;I had one of those tiny ones, and I stuffed it in my handlebar
    bag and listened to it on one earphone (so I could hear traffic with my other
    ear) most of the way across the country. &nbsp;I used AM or FM most of the
    time and listened to CBC, but there are some places in Canada where you need
    SW to get anything.
  <LI>
    luxury item most surprising to others: &nbsp;my little plastic film containers
    full of dried herbs and spices. &nbsp;A little oregano can really improve
    the flavour of a camp meal, and it sure doesn't weigh much. &nbsp;I enjoyed
    the reaction, when I would be staying with a friend or relative, to my statement
    that I was "out of basil and wondered if I could get a refill."
  <LI>
    something I might take if I were doing the trip now: &nbsp;a cellular phone.
    &nbsp;It would have been a great reassurance to know that if I got terribly
    sick or injured, or if I was stranded with a broken bike, I could have called
    for help. Of course you'd have to figure out how to deal with battery life,
    and there would be some places where it wouldn't work, but I think it would
    be interesting to consider.
</UL>
<H1>
  The List:
</H1>
<H2>
  Bike Accessories:
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    handlebar bag and panniers (I might update this choice nowadays--you can
    probably come up with a better choice. This gives you a sense of how much
    space I used, however. &nbsp;I had my sleeping bag and pad and my food sack
    strapped on to the rack over top of the panniers.)
  <LI>
    light and spare bulbs
  <LI>
    lock
  <LI>
    water jugs
  <LI>
    odometer
  <LI>
    toe clips (with the modern shoe systems, you should update this)
  <LI>
    fenders
  <LI>
    safety flag and lots of reflectors. &nbsp;I also put reflective tape on some
    of my clothing.
</UL>
<H2>
  Tools:
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    pump and tire gauge
  <LI>
    tire irons and tube repair kit
  <LI>
    6" adjustable wrench (or shifting spanner for those of you across the Atlantic)
  <LI>
    combination screwdriver
  <LI>
    allen wrenches
  <LI>
    chain tool
  <LI>
    spoke wrench
  <LI>
    all-purpose tool (dog-bone shaped thing)
  <LI>
    pliers with wire cutter
  <LI>
    Swiss army knife
  <LI>
    crank extractor
  <LI>
    the dreaded vise grips (they weigh a lot, but actually I used them a lot)
  <LI>
    freewheel remover (as I said above, this is nearly obsolete--for the modern
    rear hubs you need totally different stuff. The reason I carried a freewheel
    remover originally was because I couldn't replace a spoke on the right side
    of the rear wheel without getting the freewheel off. &nbsp;I never broke
    any spokes, but I still had to use it once for those bearings I mentioned.)
  <LI>
    other special gizmos for your bike. &nbsp;The general rule is to have a frank
    talk with yourself about what you're really prepared to fix by the side of
    the road. &nbsp;If you really would fix problem A, then take the tools to
    do that job. &nbsp;If you figure problem B would cause you to flag down a
    truck and hitch a ride to the nearest bike shop, don't take the tools for
    that.
</UL>
<H2>
  Spare Parts:
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    1 set brake pads
  <LI>
    1 brake cable (long enough for rear brake) and 1 derailleur cable (long enough
    for rear derailleur)
  <LI>
    1 spare tube
  <LI>
    4 spare spokes and nipples (make sure you include all the spoke lengths your
    bike uses)
  <LI>
    3 chain links
  <LI>
    lubricants--grease, oil, whatever you use
  <LI>
    friction tape
  <LI>
    a few assorted nuts and bolts (because having the 5-cent bolt that supports
    your pannier shear off will completely halt you until you can fix it)
  <LI>
    extra bearings (a lot of people use sealed bearings nowadays--you might decide
    you really wouldn't want to try to replace those by the side of the road)
  <LI>
    wire
</UL>
<H2>
  First Aid Kit:
</H2>
<P>
You can buy one if you want. &nbsp;I'd make sure you at least have:
<UL>
  <LI>
    aspirin or equivalent (don't forget that some of them don't work for muscle
    inflammation)
  <LI>
    bandaids
  <LI>
    sunburn lotion
  <LI>
    elastic bandage
</UL>
<H2>

</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    sleeping bag and pad
  <LI>
    waterproof drawstring bag for sleeping bag
  <LI>
    tent
  <LI>
    small axe (my advice, as I said, is to leave this out)
  <LI>

<H2>

    eating utensils
  <LI>
    dish detergent, pot scrubber, cloth, towel
  <LI>
    spatula
  <LI>
    dried herbs and spices in little containers or bags (I used plastic film
    containers)
  <LI>
    salt and pepper
  <LI>
    plastic bags
  <LI>
    some kind of separate food bag (I was going through bear country on part
    of my trip, and you don't want any of your other luggage or your tent or
    sleeping bag to smell like food. &nbsp;I had a separate knapsack strapped
    on top of the rear rack for my food.)
</UL>
<H2>
  Clothes:
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    2 t-shirts
  <LI>
    1 heavier shirt
  <LI>
    1 sweater
  <LI>
    1 pair pants
  <LI>
    1 pair cycling shorts (or two pairs and skip the next item--cycling shorts
    make a big difference)
  <LI>
    1 pair regular shorts
  <LI>
    1 shell jacket
  <LI>
    1 track suit
  <LI>
    3 pairs of socks
  <LI>
    3 pairs of underwear
  <LI>
    hat
  <LI>
    rain poncho
  <LI>
    cycling gloves
  <LI>
    helmet
  <LI>
    sunglasses
  <LI>
    swim suit
</UL>
<H2>

</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    safety pins

  <LI>
    needle
  <LI>
    thread
</UL>
<H2>
  Miscellaneous:
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    money
  <LI>
    maps (I had regular road maps, but I also got 1:1 million scale topo maps
    from the Canadian government. &nbsp;I lived in Ottawa so I just went over
    to Booth St. to buy them. &nbsp;I didn't carry all my maps with me at once.
    &nbsp;I had a couple of stashes of them at different relatives' houses along
    the route.)
  <LI>
    compass (didn't use this much)
  <LI>
    pen and paper
  <LI>
    trip journal
  <LI>
    camera and film
  <LI>
    book (take one and trade them in as you go along)
  <LI>
    shortwave radio
</UL>
<P>
So that's the list. &nbsp;You can certainly get by with less. &nbsp;I could
have. &nbsp;This was a heavy load. &nbsp;If you're travelling with others,
you can use just one tool kit for everyone and share some of the other things,
too. &nbsp;Otherwise, take my list and adapt it to your purposes. &nbsp;Remember
the general rule: &nbsp;when in doubt, leave it out.
