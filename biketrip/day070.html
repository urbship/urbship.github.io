  Day 70: Sunday, 29 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Slept in till 9:30. I eventually called Kathy I. [mechanical engineering
classmate]. Then Linda and I went out to the art gallery. That was quite
good. A display of Bouguereau.
<P>
Came back and we went to the Botanical Gardens. We were going to see a concert
of South American music but we failed to find it.
<P>
So we eventually went to a Japanese restaurant. I really like sushi. The
steak teriyaki was excellent, too.
<P>
We then went to look at the tall ships. We were going to meet Kathy I. and
her beau but this did not work out. So Linda and I went to a jazz club instead
and sat and listened to a fairly good group. Came home and talked till 2
a.m.
