  Day 69: Saturday, 28 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up about 6:30 and had breakfast. Headed off towards Montreal at 8 a.m.,
with Mom and Dad on the scooter accompanying me.
<P>
After I left them I carried on down the north side of the river. Moved rather
fast. I was at Montebello by 12:30. After Grenville I got off onto a small
secondary road.
<P>
Got to St. Eustache about 7 p.m. or so and then started finding my way through
Montreal traffic. I didn't actually get to Linda P.'s [friend from
Saskatoon--Blair P.'s sister] place till 9:30.
<P>
Wow. 215 km. By far the longest day of the trip.
<P>
I devoured four hunks of chicken and lots of other stuff. Had a shower and
Linda was home when I got out. Talked to her for a while and then collapsed.
