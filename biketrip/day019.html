  Day 19: Friday, 8 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Well, it wasn't raining when I got up this morning. I had a shower and read
for a while. Eventually packed up and left.
<P>
Made some calls from Entwistle, to Edmonton and Saskatoon. Then I rode on.
Had a wind against me almost all the way.
<P>
It seemed like a long day, even though it was much shorter than yesterday.
Towards the end of the day, I got spits of rain, but not enough to make me
put my poncho on.
<P>
I made it through the city and got to the right place. Had a meal and a visit
with the Ws [my aunt and uncle and cousins]. Uncle Bob has pneumonia, so
he wasn't very much in evidence. Hope he gets better soon.
<P>
I've averaged 137 km/day since Vancouver.
