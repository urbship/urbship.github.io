  Day 23: Tuesday, 12 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I slept in this morning, because of the late ride last night. Of course,
I didn't get away until 11:30 or so. I had to deal with a tire bump after
a few km. Faulty tube, I think. I changed to another tube.
<P>
Kept moseying along. A Park Conservation Officer stopped to check on me before
I got to Goodsoil! Radio station was looking for me. So I got him to check
on construction for me. To avoid it I turned north and went on gravel roads
through the park. Nice road.
<P>
Went skinny dipping to cool off at Mustus Lake. Rode on into the evening.
Got to Meadow Lake and tried to find the Regional Park. Ended up setting
up in a piece of grass beside the road.
