  Day 85: Monday, 13 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up and packed and had breakfast. Got going fairly late and rode to
Cavendish. Looked at Anne of Green Gables' house.
<P>
Rode along close to the coast. Lots of people were out swimming even though
it was fairly cloudy. I thought about stopping for a swim, but I didn't decide
to do it.
<P>
I eventually turned south and headed for Charlottetown. Sure didn't feel
like a long way, to cross the island.
<P>
I rolled into town and found the New Democratic Party rally. Talked to lots
of development and disarmament types. Shook hands with Ed Broadbent (then
leader of the NDP).
<P>
Then went for a pizza with a couple of guys and then found the youth hostel.
