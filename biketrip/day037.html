  Day 37: Tuesday, 26 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Was awakened for breakfast. It was raining, so the group did not head out
to the dig, but instead stayed to catalogue artifacts. So I stuck around
to wait out the rain.
<P>
Got caught up in my journal and packed up and generally watched what was
going on. Also collected a pledge or two.
<P>
Took off down the gravel road. It was a bit damp and muddy, but not too bad.
Made it across the ferry to Hwy 2.
<P>
Turned off after buying food in Glenboro, to have lunch and a look at a desert
in Spruce Woods. Amazing--real dunes and everything.
<P>
From there I went back to Hwy 2 and on to Treverne, where I found a campground.
Had a good conversation with some guys from Montreal.
