  Day 101: Wednesday, 29 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up just after the people I was staying with left for Quebec. I didn't
have breakfast--just packed up and went down to the ferry. Bought a ticket
and left my bike for a while.
<P>
Went and phoned a few radio stations and then the <CITE>Cape Breton
Post</CITE>. They wanted a picture, so I went and got my bike and rode over
to the office. Had a quick interview.
<P>
Then I had brunch and went back to the ferry. There were three other cyclists
and we all got on together--one from Australia and a couple from Ottawa.
The ferry left and we went for a beer.
<P>
Later on I met a guy with a banjo. We sat on the highest deck and jammed
for a while [taking turns on his banjo--I didn't actually have one with me].
<P>
Went for supper with the three cyclists and hung around with them. Later
on I ended up in the bar drinking soft drink with the banjo player.
