  Day 47: Friday, 6 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up when Ihor did. He left for work and I had a shower and wrote some
postcards and ate breakfast. Packed up and left. Got away about 10 a.m.
<P>
I rode pretty steadily all day. Bought a bit of food in Schreiber.
<P>
It was quite a tough day. Lots of hills. However, I still managed to push
over 160 km. Now I only have to average 155 till Waterloo area.
<P>
The road is not as bad as I thought. Long sections of it have shoulders and
there isn't as much traffic as I expected. There was on the section where
Hwy 11 and Hwy 17 were the same road. The road doesn't follow the shore very
closely--that's why there are so many hills.
