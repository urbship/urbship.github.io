  Day 55: Saturday, 14 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Woke up about 8 a.m. and had breakfast. The stove was a pain this morning.
However, I did manage to have my porridge.
<P>
Spent the morning lazing about and swimming, etc. Pretty relaxing day. Had
lunch and then did some more heavy-duty relaxing. There were quite a few
people here; somewhere around 50.
<P>
Supper started up around 5 p.m. Took a while to roast, but it was really
good. Afterwards there was a fair amount of singing. That was rather enjoyable.
<P>
Then I called Kevin [my brother] to let him know what the situation was.
Then marshmallow roasting and joke telling around the campfire. Pretty good
day, and a much-needed rest.
