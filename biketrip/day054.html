  Day 54: Friday, 13 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and cooked breakfast. Had an audience, of course. The birthday boy
returned to life and watched me pack up, etc.
<P>
Got going about ten and rode pretty steadily down Hwy 6. Didn't stop much
until I got to Fergus. Then bought groceries and took off down the back roads
through Elora, Elmira, St. Jacobs, etc., till I got to Phillipsburg.
<P>
Found the FASS [stands for Faculty, Administration, Staff, and Students--it's
a campus theatre group at the University of Waterloo] campout. Set up and
cooked supper. It felt really good to face the prospect of not going anywhere
tomorrow.
<P>
Lots of interesting conversations with FASSists around the fire. Brad T.
brought a telescope out, too.
