  Day 3: Wednesday, 23 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Up before eight today and went downtown. Saw the guy at the Nanaimo Times,
but no real bite on a story. Got some snack food for riding--I didn't have
enough yesterday; bad mistake. Got some fluorescent tape and the right washers
to fix a fender. Then I fixed the fender, packed up, and said goodbye to
the Cs.
<P>
Wandered around a goodly amount before getting on the highway--added 15 km,
but it was nice and sunny and very enjoyable. Then headed for the "hump."
<P>
Good weather till Cameron Lake and then I had this last big climb and a wet
ride into Port Alberni. Found the office of Victor C. [CUSO connection of
Dad's] and got directions to his house and rode out there. Had a great meal.
He and his fiancee are really good people.
