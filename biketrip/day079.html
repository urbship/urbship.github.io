  Day 79: Tuesday, 7 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Packed up in a rainstorm. Miserable. It ended when I climbed over the height
of land, as I expected it would. It's probably still raining over there--or
else the rain has travelled along the St. Lawrence.
<P>
I rode down a beautiful river valley most of the day. The Matapedia. Maybe
not as spectacular as the Gaspe, but still very scenic.
<P>
Got to a campsite, after having got groceries at Amqui. The campsite is close
to Matapedia.
<P>
I cooked my supper and then my stove exploded. One part was eight feet away
and another was ten feet away and I couldn't find the other part. I was standing
two feet from it at the time. So I called Mom and Dad. This evening has been
a real blast.
