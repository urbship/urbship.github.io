  Day 50: Monday, 9 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I woke up to the sound of a squirrel trying to get at my GORP. I threw a
stone at it and it went away. Got up and breakfasted.
<P>
Got away about 11 and rode to the nearest town. Spent a while looking at
wood carvings and stuff. Then rode on.
<P>
Met some cyclists halfway to Sault Ste. Marie. They told me they had come
mainly downhill since SSM. This would have put them well under the surface
of the lake.
<P>
I carried on and got to Sault about 7:30. Called Dad from a Kentucky Fried
Chicken and ate there. Then headed east into much easier riding. Now some
bimbos are keeping me awake with their stereo.
