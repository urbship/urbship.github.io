  Day 46: Thursday, 5 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
The W.'s and I got up and zipped into Thunder Bay. It was downhill and with
the wind, so we went pretty quickly. Stopped at a doughnut place and had
a snack and bid the Wilsons goodbye.
<P>
I went to tourist info and then bought a book, visited the newspaper, got
some postcards, went to two radio stations, and bought groceries. Finally
got away from Thunder Bay at 3:30 or so.
<P>
Stopped at the Terry Fox monument. Rather inspiring, actually.
<P>
Rode northeast in the rain. Eventually hit construction. Yuck. However, I
made it to Red Rock.
<P>
Found Ihor R.--he didn't think I'd make it! Anyway, we had a few beers and
talked a lot.
