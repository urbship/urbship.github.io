  Day 16: Tuesday, 5 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got off to an early start. I found the Bow Pass fairly easy. Kept meeting
the same British couple over and over. Lots of game. Saw coyotes and a bear,
etc. [Cycling past a bear beside the road made me pretty nervous. Ever been
chased by a dog on your bike? Imagine a bear.]
<P>
Rode down to Saskatchewan River Crossing. That's where I ate lunch. Carried
on from there. Had some winds against me, but I made it. Stopped at Rampart
Creek, where there were 22 cyclists coming south.
<P>
I climbed the big hill. What
a monster. That's the toughest pass, I'd say.

Got to the hostel. Lots of friendly people here--including lots of cyclists.
Heading north, but not as fast as I am.
