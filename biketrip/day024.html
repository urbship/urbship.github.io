  Day 24: Wednesday, 13 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Woke up fairly early and took off for North Battleford. Had a water problem.
Not enough starting out. So I got really thirsty and eventually filled up
at a beaver pond!
<P>
Didn't drink much of that. Soon got to a picnic ground with a pump! Had a
leisurely lunch and then continued.
<P>
Long, uphill, upwind ride. God. So I eventually got to the top and had some
downhills after that. Much needed.
<P>
Stopped a fair amount. Anyway, I was late getting in. First stop was CJNB,
where I was interviewed. Then went and found Larry R. [friend from Saskatoon].
Went out for spaghetti and then went back to his place to sack out.
