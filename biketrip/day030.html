  Day 30: Tuesday, 19 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had breakfast. Packed up and wandered down to the beach. Had a
swim--that was good.
<P>
Then I took off for Yorkton. Was against the wind most of the way. Talked
to the radio station and two newspapers. Then bought groceries and rode off
towards Duck Mountain.
<P>
The wind changed so it kept blowing against me. Then I got into a big
thunderstorm. I got to Kamsack around 11 o'clock. Bought a new flashlight
and had tea and then rode off into the night.
<P>
I made it to Duck Mountain really late (after 1 a.m.) That side trip to Yorkton
was an extra 58 km. Grumble.
