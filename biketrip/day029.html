  Day 29: Monday, 18 June, 1984

Got up at eight and then had a bath and breakfast. Dale called up the Wynyard
newspaper and a cute reporter showed up and interviewed me. [That was Sadia
Z., a summer-student reporter for the <CITE>Wynyard Advance</CITE>, who ended
up doing the most comprehensive and accurate article on my ride of any of
the 50 or so newspapers I talked to that summer. Last I heard of her, she
doing production work on the

CBC radio in Toronto.]
<P>
I packed up after that and got escorted out of town by Dale and two of her
kids on bicycles. Rode for a while. Stopped to rest and got into a great
conversation with a hitchhiker.
<P>
Then I rode on. Couldn't buy a decent supper! No stores were open on Monday.
Ridiculous.
<P>
Well, I moseyed on to Springside and then turned north on little (paved)
roads up to Good Spirit Lake. Had a bread and sausage and soup supper and
read until bedtime.
