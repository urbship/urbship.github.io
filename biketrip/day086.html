  Day 86: Tuesday, 14 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and had breakfast and then went out to find the press. Stopped at
CBC first and made an appointment for 11:30 a.m. Then talked to both newspapers.
They both took pictures, etc. Then I had the interview at CBC and then had
one at another radio station. They both went all right.
<P>
I then rode out of town and headed to the east end of the island. I rolled
up to the home of the family of Dad's friend in Ottawa. The welcomed me [even
though, as I later learned, Dad's friend had <STRONG>not</STRONG> warned
them I was coming--she said, "When is he getting there?" and Dad said, "He
was there last night!"]
<P>
Had a wonderful fish dinner and a nice evening. I was pretty ready to sleep
by 11 o'clock, though. Lots of history in this area--it's pretty interesting.
