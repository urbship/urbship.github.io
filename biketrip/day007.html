  Day 7: Sunday, 27 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up late and had breakfast with Sue C. and then rushed off to the ferry.
I missed the 9 a.m. by four minutes. Got the 11 o'clock, after a good talk
with the cashiers in the terminal restaurant!
<P>
The ferry ride was good. 20 km to Erik K.'s house. Had a rather enjoyable
afternoon with him and his roommate. Went up to the Capillano swinging bridge
and then to the beach below University of British Columbia.
<P>
Then in the evening, believe it or not, we went to a Thomas Dolby concert.
That was great! And now I'm watching a dumb movie and thinking about going
to sleep.
