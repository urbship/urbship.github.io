  Day 76: Saturday, 4 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Slept in a bit. Met a cyclist that I met at Quebec. He was planning the same
day I was, but I wasn't ready to go yet. I went and ate breakfast and repaired
my pannier. Left about noon.
<P>
What a day. The views are breathtaking. The scenery is some of the most beautiful
I've ever seen, but you pay for it. The hills are the worst I've had this
trip. I had to stand on the pedals on occasion. I also set a new record for
descent speed: 72.8 km/h. Beats the Sunwapta by 3 km/h.
<P>
I got to the hostel before Dan, the other cyclist. Passed him somewhere.
I made supper and camped and had a beer with Dan.
