  Day 91: Sunday, 19 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up bright and early, ate, packed up quickly, and barrelled down the hill
back to the road. I went along for a while. Tried calling a radio station
at 10:30, but the person I was supposed to talk to wasn't there. So I headed
for the ferry.
<P>
I didn't have time to stop at the tidal power project. In fact, I started
watching the time, pushing harder and harder. Finally made the ferry with
three minutes to spare (next one would have been 7 1/2 hours later).
<P>
Crossed and rode up to Kevin and Sheila H.'s house (friends of Barb and Craig
F. [who are old friends of our family]). They took me along to a barbecue
and I enjoyed the mob of people there.
