  Day 38: Wednesday, 27 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up to the sound of lawn mowing. This was fortunate, because I would have
slept in otherwise. Had a shower, breakfasted, and then gave the rest of
my bread to those two Montrealers, because theirs walked off in the night.
<P>
I rode down the road about 11 o'clock. Called CUSO at one point. Just kept
trucking along. Ignored one detour sign, which was a good decision. I just
had to push my bike across the dirt road beside the bridge that was out.
Stopped for a beer and they told me the detour was really bumpy.
<P>
Anyway, I carried on into Winnipeg. Arrived at Nanoo's [my grandmother] about
7:30 or 8. Had supper and spent a lot of the evening on the phone to various
people. Talked to Mom and Dad, to two CUSO types here, the S.'s [second cousins
once removed?], and Katharine C. [friend from Saskatoon].
