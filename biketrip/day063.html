  Day 63: Sunday, 22 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I scraped myself out of bed at 8:30 this morning. Was pretty slow about getting
packed. Eventually got away about 10:30.
<P>
Rode through the city and arrived at Brian W.'s (3rd year Elec. Eng.) in
Agincourt at exactly noon. He was having a pool party. That was rather good.
It was a great day for it.
<P>
At 3 p.m. I moseyed onwards. Rode out to Whitby and found Kathy I.'s [mechanical
engineering classmate] house. Went out to Harvey's with her and her family.
That was pretty good. Quite a coincidence. She just happened to be passing
through on her way from London, Ont., to Montreal, Que.
<P>
I rode up to a nearby campground and had my ear bent by a young question-asker
as I was setting up.
