  Day 84: Sunday, 12 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up late and read for a while before taking off. Felt somewhat lazy,
so I didn't leave till 1 p.m.
<P>
Rode to the ferry. Had to wait till the 4:30 one, so I called Dad. They have
a really dumb line-up procedure at that ferry. Hurry up and wait.
<P>
After I crossed I rode to Summerside. Things are pretty close together here.
<P>
When I was buying a few groceries there I met a motorcyclist who I had also
met on Manitoulin Island on 11 July. Amazing coincidence.
<P>
I pushed on to Cavendish. Rode fairly late, but I was able to cook quite
well because the shelter in the campground was lighted.
