  Day 12: Friday, 1 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Great day. I escaped last night's campground without paying $10. I don't
like to do that, but it was an outrageous price. It was a glorious sunny
day <STRONG>all day</STRONG>. I rode in a T-shirt and took that off at lunch.
<P>
Missed my contact in Kelowna, but met some really good people in Vernon.
Also met a happy hitchhiker from Montreal. Stephen M. Gave me his brother's
address. On the whole a good day for people.
<P>
I pushed all the way to Enderby; not as long as yesterday, but still a good
ride. I'm going to have to motor to make Edmonton in a week.
