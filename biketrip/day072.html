  Day 72: Tuesday, 31 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Up at 8:30. Had a great breakfast and rode off down the Richelieu River.
Eventually got onto Hwy 132 and followed that for quite a while.
<P>
Eventually stopped for groceries and then lunch by the roadside. Stopped
for ice cream once or twice as well. Stopped to get tourist info. My French
was much needed, so I had to scrape some of the rust off it.
<P>
Met a cyclist out training who told me how to get across the bridge to
Trois-Rivieres. So I did. Found the youth hostel. Ate supper and then played
Risk (lost) with a couple of guys. La Riske Francaise.
