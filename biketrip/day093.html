  Day 93: Tuesday, 21 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up really early and had a terrific blueberry pancake breakfast with Barb
and Craig. I took off around 8:30--didn't really feel like going.
<P>
I stopped at the <CITE>Daily Gleaner</CITE> and had a quick interview and
then at Atlantic Television. They did quite a long piece and even followed
me out the highway for some road shots. [Apparently this piece was broadcast
region-wide. ATV is a CTV affiliate. That was my biggest TV exposure of the
trip.]
<P>
I rode on--about 1:00 p.m. I couldn't stand my back wheel, so I stopped to
work on it. Ended up taking the freewheel off (!) and replacing four bearings
in the back wheel. N.B. that is <STRONG>exactly</STRONG> how many spares
I had of that size. Lucky! I put it all back together and continued on the
long road to Saint John.
<P>
Arrived at a radio station at 8:30 p.m. and had an interview. Then had a
pizza and beer at a restaurant. Rode up to Kevin and Sheila's place. Visited
and watched TV for a while before crashing.
