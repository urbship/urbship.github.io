  Day 74: Thursday, 2 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Today I got up bright and early and went to CBC. The interview went well
and I got over $100 in donations! They were rather nice in there.
<P>
I went to Tourist Info after that and got a walking tour of Quebec pamphlet.
So off I set. It was a really hot day, so I had ice cream cones, etc., along
the way.
<P>
Towards the end of the day I arrived at one park where there was a tour of
the old redoubt, etc. [Parc de l'Artillerie.] The tour guide was cute--she
made a donation and we got talking and we decided I'd give her a call at
7 p.m.
<P>
So after clothes washing, supper with two other cyclists, and a conversation
in French with people at the hostel, I met her and her friend and we went
to an outdoor concert and wandered around the old port.
