  Day 96: Friday, 24 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up around 9 a.m. and got going on a few things, like breakfast, laundry,
etc. I got the laundry mostly done by about 10:45.
<P>
Then we went down to the main newspaper office and I had an interview with
a rather cute journalist. Then dropped by the CUSO office and read all Dad's
notes and phoned Annapolis Valley Radio.
<P>
After lunch, went looking for an antenna for my radio--failed. Then got a
few bearings at the Trail Shop. Had a long talk with a guy there.
<P>
Back to CUSO. Went to the Grad Club with Linda and met Nancy E., Phil S.,
and various other people [all CUSOBOTs]. Jim H. [another CUSOBOT] is in town
but wasn't there. Then out to supper with Linda and her neato boyfriend and
back here to watch <CITE>Dallas</CITE>.
