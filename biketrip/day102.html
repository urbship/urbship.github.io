  Day 102: Thursday, 30 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Well, it wasn't a completely restful night. I should have brought my Ensolite
pad up. Would have been more comfortable. Oh well, I got some sleep. Met
the three cyclists for breakfast and we got off the ship together.
<P>
My rear tire was slowly leaking, so I pumped it up now and then. The four
of us travelled together as fas as the Trans-Canada Highway. Stopped for
lunch along the way.
<P>
The Australian woman, Joyce D., and I rode north from the Trans-Canada and
the other two rode east on the Trans-Canada. We reached Joyce's campsite
about 6:30 p.m. and stopped for a beer.
<P>
Then I rode onwards. Eventually had to fix my tire. It was going flat too
fast. Arrived at Salmon Cove beach at 11 p.m.
