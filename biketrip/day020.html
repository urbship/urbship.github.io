  Day 20: Saturday, 9 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Slept in till 10:30 or so. Had breakfast and called Doug V. [a friend from
Saskatoon]. He sounded all right. Agreed to pop over in the afternoon. Dave
and Lindy S. [more CUSOBOTs] called and wanted to see me this evening.
<P>
So I did things like drying out my tent and cleaning my knapsack. Then went
out shopping. Bought a postcard. Doug V. was along on that jaunt, so we got
lots of talking done. Kilimanjaro in 1987 is still on [that sure never
happened!].
<P>
Had my interview with the Edmonton Journal at five. That was neat. Thought
of two or three things I should have said after, though. They took a roll
of film.
<P>
Then had a great supper at Aunt Sheila's. Went to S.'s for a while. Kids
were both asleep, but I had a good visit. Then went back to W.'s and visited
until about 1 or 1:30.
