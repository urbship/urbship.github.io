  Day 71: Monday, 30 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I awoke fairly late today. Linda called in sick, so she was still around.
<P>
I eventually got a call from Joan T. [CUSO person], saying come down to the
CUSO office around noon. I got packed up by then and rolled down the hill
to the office. Oh--before that I called CHEZ radio in Ottawa and that went
well. At CUSO I called to CBC Quebec City to set something up.
<P>
Dropped in on Kathy I. Seems she and Tex were on a boat, so that's how we
missed each other last night.
<P>
Headed out of town at 3 p.m. and arrived Chez R. [family friends from Saskatoon]
at 5:15. We went for a swim, had an excellent supper, and then watched some
TV. I was quite tired when I got to bed.
