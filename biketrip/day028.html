  Day 28: Sunday, 17 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I slept in again--I'm getting really sloppy that way. I had a leasurely breakfast
and got into reading <CITE>The Covenant</CITE>. Then took my tent down. Had
to sew a grommet back in. So I didn't actually leave till 2 p.m.
<P>
By that time I had a massive wind behind me. Hit 18th gear--50.4 km/h at
one point. At Plunkett I stopped to phone home and then the S.'s [my godparents].
Good to talk to Mom and Dad, etc.
<P>
Then I continued plowing along at incredible speeds. Stopped at the Kandahar
Steak House for supper. That wasn't as good as I remembered. Oh well.
<P>
Rode on to Wynyard and found Bill C.'s and Dale D.'s [friends of Dad's] place
and scrounged a place to crash.
