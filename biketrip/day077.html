  Day 77: Sunday, 5 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up and had breakfast at that strange youth hostel. Then I went and
packed up. Got down from the campsite about 11 a.m. Dan was there as well
as another cyclist named Mario, who I've seen occasionally since Trois-Rivieres.
Mario left and then I left and Dan stayed.
<P>
I carried on and then stopped to swim at a nice lake. Arrived at the ferry
after 41 km and it didn't leave till 5:45 p.m. So we waited.
<P>
Went and got some fruit for me and a woman who was waiting. There was also
a Torontonian woman doing a French immersion. Two French [from France] cyclists
arrived. Then we sailed over to Trois-Pistoles.
<P>
The four cyclists decided to camp together--Mario, the two French people,
and me. We shared a meal and a lot of conversation. My French is continuing
to grow.
