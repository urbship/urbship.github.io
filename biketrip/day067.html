  Day 67: Thursday, 26 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I didn't get into action very early today. I got up about 9:30, but I didn't
actually roll out until after noon.
<P>
Headed out to the <CITE>Citizen</CITE> and worked my way towards the centre
of town, stopping at various media on the way. I mostly got "come back tomorrow"
from them. Appointments might have been better. Got one intervew with CJSB
radio. I quit when I got to CHEZ. Just got tired and went home.
<P>
After supper we had this sort of reception at our house. Quiet thing, with
family friends. Dad was having a disarmament meeting simultaneously. Everything
quieted down after a while and I got to bed about 12:30.
