  Day 52: Wednesday, 11 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up and packed and took off. Rode back down the gravel road to the highway.
I pushed on down number 17. Didn't stop much, because I was looking forward
to getting off that horrible highway.
<P>
Turned south on Hwy 6. Called CUSO from Espanola and then carried on. Had
a good conversation with an Ontario Provincial Police officer who stopped.
<P>
I rode pretty late on Hwy 6. It was almost totally deserted and the moon
was full. Felt so good after the Trans-Canada.
<P>
I rode all the way to South Baymouth at the south side of Manitoulin Island.
Found a campground quite close to the ferry.
