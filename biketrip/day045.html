  Day 45: Wednesday, 4 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and slowly got ready. Had a shower, etc. Got going about 11 a.m. and
zipped down the road with the wind behind me.
<P>
Eventually phoned and tried to reach Larry Cruse in Thunder Bay. Couldn't
get ahold of him. Got Ihor R. [classmate from Waterloo], though.
<P>
Carried on to meet the Trans-Canada and encountered two cyclists--father
and son. Travelled with them. Decided not to go to Kakabeka Falls, but to
tag along with them instead.
<P>
We just found a flat spot near the road. Stopped and camped and ate some
food. Had lots of good conversation, too. Anyway, now I think I've got all
the mosquitoes [in the tent] and can retire.
