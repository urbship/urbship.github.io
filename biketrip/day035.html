  Day 35: Sunday, 24 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up for breakfast. A few people (like Janet S., the bride, and Chicho,
the groom) started trickling back. Eventually it was gift opening time. They
sure got a load of great presents--lots of pottery, and even a complete set
of china. Then another breakfast--brunch, I guess. Lots of frisbee playing.
<P>
We went down to the Little Saskatchewan River and had a swim. It was a really
hot day. Just gorgeous. I had been thinking of taking off, but it didn't
seem opportune.
<P>
So I helped take the chairs and tables back to Brandon and then had supper.
The evening was kind of a time for the S. brothers to visit--I sensed that
they don't get together that often, like our family. Anyway, it was rather
nice.
