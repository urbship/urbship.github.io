  Day 78: Monday, 6 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 8 a.m. and had a shower and read until the other three got up.
We had breakfast together and then packed up and said goodbye.
<P>
I rode off at a good pace but eventually slowed down. I tried phoning CUSO
once but it's a holiday in Ottawa. I bought groceries in Rimouski and then
rode on. Passed by Mont-Joli without stopping.
<P>
Got to Sainte-Angele-de-Merici and found a campground. Set up after a hearty
supper and went to bed early.
<P>
Lots of thunder in the vicinity. Might be a lousy day tomorrow. It gets dark
much earlier now--I also couldn't find much on the radio here--just the BBC.
