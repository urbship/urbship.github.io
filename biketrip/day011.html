  Day 11: Thursday, 31 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Arose this a.m. and had a hot shower. Had breakfast and packed up, paid and
left.
<P>
It was a long, downhill, with-the-wind ride all the way to Keremeos. Quite
relaxing. I made good time without much effort.
<P>
I turned left out of Keremeos and started climbing, so I stopped for lunch.
The wind was against me for a while, but came back as I was working on the
really steep hill. Then it was blowing against me again as I made my way
to Penticton.
<P>
Got groceries there and continued to a campground 10 km north of Summerland.
A really long day. It was almost nine when I stopped.
