  Day 39: Thursday, 28 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up fairly early and made a couple of quick phone calls. Had a shower
and breakfast as well. Then took off for a whole bunch of chores.
<P>
Bought a new tire and then had a few interviews, mostly with radio stations.
Then I met Moses M. and Harry F. at the CUSO office. After the <CITE>Winnipeg
Sun</CITE> took a picture or 30 I went for lunch with Harry.
<P>
Then off to Nanoo's for supper. We had Dairy Queen treats afterwards. Later
on, the S.'s [long-time family friends] popped in. That was great.
<P>
I kept working away at all these chores and organizing myself until it was
time to go to bed.
