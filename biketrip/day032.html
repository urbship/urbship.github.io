  Day 32: Thursday, 21 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and moseyed off towards Dauphin. I got there at 4 o'clock or so. Found
the three media. Took a while to get the newspaper people to understand what
I was talking about. ("Well, when is this rally going to be held?" "I'm here,
NOW!")
<P>
The radio was a riot. The guy couldn't get the typewriter to work, so he
slapped me on the air with no warning. That was neat.
<P>
I got a few groceries and then headed for Riding Mountain National Park.
The weather became gorgeous. Got hot climbing the escarpment so I went
skinny-dipping in a convenient lake.
<P>
Eventually got to Wasagaming and phoned Nanoo [my grandmother]. Tried to
phone Katja H. but she wasn't there.
