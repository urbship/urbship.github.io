  Day 83: Saturday, 11 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Amazing informality here--no one bothered me for camping on the riverbank.
I got up and went to get some milk and water. Had a good breakfast and then
broke camp.
<P>
I called CBC, the daily newspaper, and the big radio station. I got interviewed
by the radio, but neither of the others was very interested.
<P>
I did laundry, bought a new cable, and had lunch (on the house!) at a
delicatessen. I eventually rode up towards Magnetic Hill. That was somewhat
interesting.
<P>
Then rode back through town and out Hwy 6. I ploughed along, past Dorchester
Penitentiary and the Sackville shortwave transmitters. Then decided it wasn't
very far to Charlottetown, so I stopped at the next campground.
