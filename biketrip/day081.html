  Day 81: Thursday, 9 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I was pretty lazy this morning. Didn't get up till 9 a.m. and then doddled
around. Finally left at noon.
<P>
I rode into Bathurst and talked to a couple of newspapers. That made me really
late. I carried on south against a wind. Met a guy who was riding out, when
I stopped to change a cable.
<P>
I bought a few groceries in Chatham and then started out along Hwy 117. It
eventually got dark and there weren't any campgrounds. I just kept riding.
<P>
Stopped to get water in a little store and asked advice. Kept on going and
eventually reached Escuminac. Just past the town I found a beach. Set up
on the sand and cooked supper. I love this place.
