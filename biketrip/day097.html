  Day 97: Saturday, 25 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up fairly early, but didn't feel like moving that fast today. I never
seem to feel like leaving that early when I'm in a good place with good people.
Anyway, I eventually got packed up.
<P>
Had a few pictures taken by Michael (Linda's "significant other" is a United
Press International photographer). Then rode up the bridge and through Dartmouth
and up Hwy 7.
<P>
I eventually stopped to buy a bit of food. Ate lunch outside the store, too.
I rode till I got to Murphy's Cove and pulled into a campground there. $4.00
isn't bad.
<P>
There were two other groups of cyclists there. Lots of conversation. Had
my macaroni and then set up the tent and retired early.
