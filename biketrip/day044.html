  Day 44: Tuesday, 3 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I arose at 8 a.m. and had breakfast. Got packed up and managed to get going
about 11 o'clock.
<P>
I rode pretty steadily today. The road was pretty empty and the wind was
mostly behind me, so I made pretty good mileage.
<P>
Called CUSO at one point and bought a bit of food. Kept pushing. Stores,
etc., were just close enough together to keep me supplied with water.
<P>
Ran into construction today, with patches of gravel, but I survived. Other
than that the road was pretty good, because the traffic was very light.
<P>
Anyway, I did 172 km and stopped at a rather nice little resort. Called Mom
and Dad and received the news that Elaine [my sister] broke her collarbone
on a motorcycle. How ironic.
