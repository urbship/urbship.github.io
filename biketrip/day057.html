  Day 57: Monday, 16 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up at the same time as Kevin and began doing laundry. I didn't go at
it in an extremely energetic manner, so it took all morning.
<P>
In the meantime I talked to Tina and her friends [Tina was a neighborhood
kid]. Seven-year-olds are interesting conversationalists.
<P>
Eventually moseyed down to the University. Picked up a roll of developed
slides on the way--great exposure. Set up some interviews with Gazette and
Imprint [campus papers], talked to Susan I., picked up OSAP [Ontario Student
Assistance Program--also known as the Ontario Stereo Acquisition Program
by the more cynical] forms, etc.
<P>
Came home and ate supper with the mob. Kevin didn't feel like working on
his item [some report, as I recall], so I stayed home and watched TV, etc.
I need some mindless time. Pete H. [friend from university] was here, too,
and Dave C. [housemate from university] and he and I had a long visit.
