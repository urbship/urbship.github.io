  Dave's Cross-Canada Bike Trip
</H1>
<P>
In 1984 I took a summer off and bicycled across Canada. I didn't take a very
direct route, because I wanted to see a few things, so I ended up pedalling
10,778 km. It took 102 days.
<P>
I raised about $10,000 for an aid organization called
<A HREF="http://www.cuso.org/">CUSO</A> and a few hundred more for a group
called <A HREF="http://www.ploughshares.ca/">Project Ploughshares</A>. That's
about what the trip cost me in cash and lost earnings. It wasn't a stunning
success, but it probably raised more awareness than if I had just donated
the money out of my own pocket.
<P>
I travelled solo, camping half the time and staying with friends or
CUSO/Ploughshares contacts the other half. The toughest aspect was not the
physical part (though that had its moments) but rather the intense pressure
of needing to be totally self-sufficient. That was before the days of cheap
cellular phones. If anything serious had happened to me on a lonely stretch
of highway, I could have very quickly got in major difficulties.
<P>
I dithered a bit about what to post about my bike trip, and finally decided
to dig out my old trip journal and type it in. I have never re-read that
journal since it was written, believe it or not, so this is going to be an
adventure for all of us.
<P>
I rode through all ten of Canada's provinces, in the order shown below. You
can start where you want:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day001.html">British Columbia</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day015.html">Alberta</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day023.html">Saskatchewan</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day031.html">Manitoba</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day042.html">Ontario</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day069.html">Quebec</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day080.html">New Brunswick</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day084.html">Prince Edward Island</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day087.html">Nova Scotia</A>
  <LI>
    and then I went <STRONG>back</STRONG> into <A HREF="day091.html">New
    Brunswick</A>
  <LI>
    and then forward again into <A HREF="day094.html">Nova Scotia</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="day102.html">Newfoundland</A>
</UL>
<P>
I've also posted a few images:
<UL>

    JPEG image</A>)
  <LI>

    (<A HREF="superior.jpeg">56k JPEG image</A>)
  <LI>

    (<A HREF="mayor.jpeg">80k JPEG image</A>)
  <LI>
    camping on the beach outside Escuminac, New Brunswick
    (<A HREF="nbbeach.jpeg">52k JPEG image</A>)
  <LI>
    camping at Salmon Cove, Newfoundland (<A HREF="salmon.jpeg">42k JPEG image</A>)
  <LI>
    boats in a natural harbour in Newfoundland (<A HREF="harbour.jpeg">47k JPEG
    image</A>)
</UL>
<P>
Some readers have
asked for a <A HREF="take.html">list of what I took</A> with me. &nbsp;It
took me a while to find it in my stuff (this was over 12 years ago, after
all), but I have now done so. &nbsp;If you're planning a major solo bike
trip, you might find it interesting.
<P>
I hope to add some more text later, enriching the material covered in the
diary. As I read through it, a lot of memories came to me that aren't written
down yet. I'll be adding them as I do them.
