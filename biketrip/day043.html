  Day 43: Monday, 2 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and began packing. Did a little bike maintenance, etc. Eventually
got going around noon. Tad late, what?
<P>
I rode south, going up and down a lot, and pushing against a wind (as usual).
It took a rather long time to reach the junction with Hwy 11, but I did
eventually.
<P>
When I turned east, the wind was more friendly. I rolled into Fort Frances
at about 10 o'clock and stopped at the Dairy Queen for supper. I was just
finishing and setting up to take off again when the editor of the local paper
and a reporter walked out and asked me where I was going. Well, they got
some pictures and a story.
<P>
Then I found a campsite, just out of town, quickly set up among the mosquitoes
and sacked out.
