  Day 82: Friday, 10 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
I got up on the beach.<br>

Didn't have that much breakfast, because I didn't have any fresh water. So I packed
up and headed into town and had a cheeseburger. After talking to a bunch
of guys for a while, I left for Moncton.
<P>
I rode slowly but steadily. The first part was rather beautiful. Then I got
onto Hwy 11. Pretty small for a main highway. Then got off onto Hwy 134.
Nice and quiet.
<P>
Rode right into Moncton. Asked a policeman where I should stay. He suggested
camping in a city park!
<P>
So I went to the Tidal Bore Look-out and watched the tide come in (perfect
timing). Munched on some food and then set up my tent.
