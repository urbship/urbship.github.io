  Day 89: Friday, 17 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up in my rather less than perfect roadside campsite and had breakfast.
Two other cyclists passed just as I was getting up. I didn't get on the road
till three hours later.
<P>
I rode up and down along the Fundy coast all day. It was cloudy, but never
actually rained.
<P>
Stopped in Windsor eventually to buy a few groceries and phoned some Ploughshares
people in Wolfville. They invited me to stay there.
<P>
I encountered the same two cyclists as I was leaving Windsor and later on
on the road. Rode with them part way to Wolfville.
<P>
The T.s welcomed me like one of their own--quite marvellous. I made my own
supper and talked with them. The New Democratic Party candidate for the riding
lives downstairs.
