  Day 92: Monday, 20 August, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 7 a.m. and had breakfast with Kevin and Sheila. Packed up quickly
and took off. I rode for a while and then stopped to phone "the media".
<P>
Then I continued up the road, on some of the back roads of the area. I think
it was somewhat longer that way. This is evident from the rather long mileage
for the day. 150 km is a reasonable day.
<P>
It was rainy almost all day. At about 5:15 I stopped at Oromocto to phone
and get directions to Barb and Craig F.'s [friends of our family] house.
Also called a few media people for fun.
<P>
Then carried on--into and out of Fredericton. Supper was waiting when I got
here. Had two radio phone interviews. Dad called from S.'s house in Winnipeg,
too. [S.s are Barb's parents.]
