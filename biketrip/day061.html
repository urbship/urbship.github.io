  Day 61: Friday, 20 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Up bright and early and down to CBC. I got interviewed by Joe Cote on Metro
Morning. That went quite well.
<P>
After that I picked up my stuff at the O.s' and rode to Bob's apartment.
He was there, so I talked to him for a while. Got a key.
<P>
Then went to the CUSO office and planned the onslaught on city hall. At 1
p.m. I was at Nathan Phillips Square. Was met by the mayor, Art Eggleton<BR>

and he presented me with a
Sesquicentennial coin. Some kids even wanted my autograph (giggle).
<P>
Went to lunch with the CUSO group. Then back to the apartment. Sort of collapsed.
I eventually got going again.
<P>
Had supper in a neat little bistro and then saw <CITE>Ghostbusters</CITE>,
which was really funny.
