  Day 62: Saturday, 21 July, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 10 a.m. and called Linda R.'s [mechanical engineering classmate]
mom. She called Linda, who then called me. Made plans for lunch with her.
Then started my laundry. I had it done by the time Linda arrived from St.
Catharine's.
<P>
We had a great talk over Lebanese food (in a restaurant I'd actually been
to before!) She left about 5 p.m., after dropping me off at the apartment.
<P>
So I hung around for a while. Called a few people and eventually made a date
with Wendy P. (2nd year Chem. Eng.) Walked downtown and had a hamburger.
Then met Wendy. We saw <CITE>Romancing the Stone</CITE> and then had a couple
of drinks. It was rather nice.
