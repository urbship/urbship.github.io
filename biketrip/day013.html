  Day 13: Saturday, 2 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up and caught some rays as I was having breakfast and packing up. It
was another terrific day.
<P>
I called home at one point and learned from Elaine [my sister] that the three
kids were going to P.'s for a barbecue. A while after that I rode past this
rock with about 25 people on top of it having a party. They tossed me down
a Kokanee [beer] and I drank it and climbed up.
<P>
Stayed there for a while and got some addresses and stuff and was invited
to stay in Revelstoke. So I rode on. Made a call to P.'s and surprised them
[the Ps and my sibs].
<P>
Rode into Revelstoke and eventually found the people's place. Sat and drank
Kokanee and watched MTV and went to bed around 12:30. Party in the middle
of the night so sleep was a bit interrupted.
