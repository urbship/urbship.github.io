  Day 17: Wednesday, 6 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Started out from the hostel this morning and rode to the Icefields, where
the cycling group caught up to me. I bought a postcard. Then I fixed one
girl's brakes. Wouldn't be very good to let her head down the hill with no
brakes.
<P>
Then I left. Zipped down the hill. Stopped by the hostel where they are staying
and left a note.
<P>
I had a good ride to Jasper. Bit of a wind against me but not too strong.
Met four other cyclists--two from Holland, one from Britain, and one Australian.
<P>
Bought groceries in Jasper and had no time for doddling so I headed out.
God, what a wind. Pushed against it all the way to Pocahontas. Then climbed
a 2 km hill to the campsite. Brutal day.
