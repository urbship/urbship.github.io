  Day 21: Sunday, 10 June, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 8:30 or so. Had a shower and then breakfasted with cousin Erinne
and Auntie Sheila. Great pancakes. I packed everything up. Felt a certain
reluctance to leave such a congenial place to stay. Oh well, only five days
to Saskatoon.
<P>
I rode to Fort Saskatchewan and stopped there to see the museum. A special
event was on so, for example, one house that had been moved to the site was
being shown by a lady who had lived in it.
<P>
Anyway, I rode onwards. Called Blair P. [friend in Saskatoon] and Mom during
the day.
<P>
Rode till after nine and then stopped to camp in a nice little spot. Standard
northern prairie campground. Since it's dry, it's a much easier camping
experience than I had before Edmonton.
