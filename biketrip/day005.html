  Day 5: Friday, 25 May, 1984
</H1>
<P>
Got up at 8:30 and surveyed the damage last night's raccoon family had wrought.
No breakfast. So I packed up and did a bit of bike investigation. Could find
no reason for Gerald to complain [Gerald was the bike's name].
<P>
Well, I left. Stopped after a few km and went to dip Gerald's rear wheel
in the Pacific. Took a dip myself. Cold!
<P>
Then, feeling cool and damp and hungry, I stopped at Wickanninish Bay for
lunch. Met some people from the campground and talked to them. Got a pledge!
<P>
Then set off in the rain. Sore knee all the way and never once took off my
poncho. Met a woman cycling alone and had a chat. Eventually rolled into
Victor C.'s place after seven. Had a marvellous evening with them, tired
as I was. Boy, they're terrific.
