I got up late today. Had a quick dip in the Atlantic Ocean.<BR>

Boy, was that cold! Much different
from the Nova Scotia coast.
<P>
I didn't get going very early. Rode down the Peninsula. People are sure friendly
in this province. It was really beautiful<BR>

too. I'm glad I didn't just take the Trans-Canada.
<P>
Eventually called Paul F. [CUSO person]. Finally got him. Phone booths are
scarce here. Anyway, they expected me in the early afternoon for some reason.
They seemed disappointed that I wouldn't arrive till evening.
<P>
I was given the number of Linda R. Called her when I hit the city. She got
me a room in the Parkview Inn. So I got there. Watched TV and had a cold
supper in my room.
