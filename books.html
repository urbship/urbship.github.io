      <h3>The Western Canon</h3>
      <p>I have read widely and constantly since grade one, but since about 1996, 
        I've had a number of major reading projects underway. I got interested 
        in the book <i>The Western Canon</i> by Harold Bloom, and decided to read 
        the major works that are the subjects of each of his chapters. 
      <p> 
      <p>I started with the complete works of <a href="shakespeare.html">Shakespeare</a>, 
        which took me about three years to read. 
      <p>The <a href="westerncanon.html">other major works I read after that are 
        listed here</a>.

      <h3>Canadian Literature</h3>
      <p>Then I decided to catch up on my Canadian literature. Obviously, I've 
        read Canadian literature all my life, but in the appendix of Bloom's book 
        there was a short list of Canadian works, and that identified some gaps. 
        So I read them. <a href="canlit.html">The list is here</a>. 
      <p>Then one day I was talking to a friend whose rich and varied cultural 
        heritage includes a significant connection to Quebec culture. I was talking 
        about Robertson Davies and the various novels that I had enjoyed so much. 
        She had not heard of him, but then said, &quot;But I've read Kamouraska 
        and some of the works of Michel Tremblay, and most English Canadians have 
        not.&quot; I realized she was right, and that I had read little of the 
        literature of French Canada other than <i>Maria Chapdelaine</i> and <i>The 
        Tin Flute</i>. I didn't even know enough about French Canadian literature 
        to identify the major works. 
      <p> 
      <p>I thought I might just find some websites out there that would give various 
        opinions on what the French Canadian literary canon ought to include, 
        but actually I didn't. I got books out of the library and poked around 
        in the reference section for other lists, and eventually put together 
        a list of my own. I've shown it to some French Canadians, and others educated 
        in Quebec, and it seems to meet with reasonable approval, at least as 
        a starting point. <a href="frenchcanadiancanon.html">The list is here</a>.

      <h3>Third World Literature</h3>
      <p>A number of years ago, in 1989, <i>New Internationalist</i> magazine 
        published a list of novels from countries that were then called &quot;Third 
        World.&quot; I read them at the time and thought most of them were outstanding. 
        <a href="thirdworldlit.html">That list is here.</a></p>

      <h3>More Great Stuff to Read</h3>
      <p>So what's next after I finish that? Well, I do have a longer list of 
        &quot;great works,&quot; but I'm not intending to diligently read through 
        all of them. Just pick and choose from it when I feel like it. I do find, 
        often, that the works that have stood the test of time and ended up on 
        these lists of &quot;greats&quot; usually do have something of value in 
        them. It's less hit-and-miss than reading the latest bestsellers. Anyway, 
        the <a href="thebigreadinglist.html">big list is here</a>. </p>

      <h3>The &quot;BBC&quot; 100 Books List</h3>
      <p>Ok, this isn't really the BBC 100 Books list, but it's the one that's 
        been circulating on Facebook. <a href="fauxbbcreadinglist.html">Here</a> 
        it is. I've read all of them and I am writing little blurbs on them.</p>
      <p>I have also now posted the <a href="realbbcreadinglist.html">real BBC 
        100 Books list</a>. I haven't yet read all of those.</p>

      <h3>The Norwegian Book Club 100 Books List</h3>
      <p>This list was put together by a book club in Norway, who polled 100 authors 
        from around the world, asked them each for 10 recommendations of important 
        books, and compiled a list of 100 from the results. It's more international 
        than either the &quot;BBC&quot; list or the real BBC list, so it seems 
        like it might be interesting to explore. The <a href="Norwegian%20Book%20List.html">Norwegian 
        Book Club list</a> is posted here.<br>
