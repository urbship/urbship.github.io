<H1> The Faux BBC Top 100 List - Really from the Guardian!</H1>

<p>This is a list that has been circulating on Facebook, purporting to be a top 
  100 list put together by BBC audiences. Supposedly an average person (in the 
  UK?) would have read 6 of them. Actually, this is not <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml">the 
  list the BBC came up with</a>, and the BBC never made that claim about either 
  their list or this one. This list is, in fact, from the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper, 
  which published it in March 2007. They have it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/mar/01/news">posted 
  on their website</a>, along with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/01/topstories3.books">a 
  story about how it was created</a>. It was based on an on-line poll conducted 
  by a charity called <a href="http://www.worldbookday.com">World Book Day</a> 
  in 2007, in which 2000 contributors each nominated the 10 books they couldn't 
  live without. Okay, but here's the thing. Book number 76 on this list is Dante's 
  Inferno, but book number 76 on the original list (if you follow the link above) 
  is The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. All I can say is that it was Dante when I first 
  encountered the list.
<p>I have now finished reading all the books on this list and have added some 
  comments about them. E-mail me if you want to add some comments of your own.

      <div align="left">I had to go reread passage of this when I was reading 
        <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i> in 2009. The original Jane Austen 
        is the better book, I must say. The joke in <i>Zombies</i> doesn't really 
        sustain for that long a book. I should actually go back and read the whole 
        original book again, because I quite enjoyed it as a teenager.<br>
        When I was working on comments for Austen's novels, some of the plot summaries 
        struck me as extremely familiar, as though I had read books with similar 
        plots much more recently. Turns out other people have noticed similarities 
        between Austen's plots and those of several novels by Anthony Trollope, 
        and I read over a dozen of Trollope's novels a couple of years ago. <i>Framley 
        Parsonage</i>, the fourth novel in the Barchester Chronicles, has striking 
        similarities to <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.</div>

        &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge,&quot; which is much like that. Tess therefore 
        struck me as grossly unfair, because of course her early &quot;mistake&quot; 
        is not her own - she is a victim. Now I think I would likely read it differently 
        - as an exploration of how an assault can go on victimizing someone long

          how we think about how we think. The internal monologue he showed us 
          in his characters helped us understand how people change and grow. Not 
          only did he change all literature after him, but he changed everything 
          before him, because we can no longer read anything without seeing it 
          through his lens.<br>

        odd, though. Characters like Betsey Trotwood, Uriah Heep, and Mr Micawber 
        end up being played brilliantly and memorably, and you can't remember 
        who played David. (Incidentally, there's a great version from 1999 with 
        Maggie Smith as Betsey Trotwood and Bob Hoskins as Micawber. It's brilliant.

        to me years later. I also think &quot;the Glums&quot; is the best musical 
        I've ever seen. I saw it in 1986-87 twice, when Colm Wilkinson was still 
        playing Valjean. Though I love it, this book is pretty immense. I tried 
        reading it to the kids at one point (they were both old enough to understand 
        it) it we got about a third of the way into it. Our lives were so busy 
        that it was hard to find times when we could read, so it was going to 
        be years before we finished. We gave up.</div>
