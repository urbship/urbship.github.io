  <LI>
    Membership is limited to 20 families.
  <LI>
    Members must live within [specified boundaries] to allow for convenient
    transportation of children.
  <LI>
    New members will pay $2 upon joining to cover original copying costs, mailing,
    etc. All families pay $2 at each April general meeting. Dues at the October
    meeting will be $0, $1, or $2 depending on a formula that ensures the treasury
    is at least $40, but doesn't get too large. If a member does not get their
    dues to the chair prior to the end of the month of the general meeting, the
    amount due will be doubled. Dues are used for copying, postage, office supplies,
    and babysitting for the general meeting.
  <LI>
    Members who don't use the co-op (sitting and gadding) five times in a period
    of three months will be asked to drop from the co-op (under discretion of
    chair when there is no waiting list, or for extenuating circumstances).
  <LI>
    Each member gives one hour to the secretary at the beginning of each month.
  <LI>
    Initiation or termination of co-op membership is handled through the chair
    where effective dates are made official.

  <LI>
    Members arrange their own sitting time with other members.
  <LI>
    Children will be sitter's main responsibility and will be under his/her constant
    care. Sitting will normally occur in sitter's home (rather than gadder's),
    although other arrangements can be made.
  <LI>
    Sitter may not leave home, transport children in car, or leave children in
    the care of another without permission of gadder, except in extreme emergency.
  <LI>
    No spanking or hitting a child. Any discipline problems should be discussed
    with the parents.
  <LI>
    Sitter and gadder determine and agree on hours to be reported at the end
    of each sit. Each member reports detailed sitting and gadding hours (per
    family, per day) to the secretary at the end of the month or no later than
    the 2nd of the following month, even if the co-op was not used for the month.
    Having members report hours as accurately and quickly as possible is crucial
    for the secretary to balance the books and report correct hours back to members.
  <LI>
    Fifteen (15) minutes or more is counted as 1/2 hour.
  <LI>
    An overnight sit is from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. and counts as six hours unless
    night feedings are necessary.
  <LI>
    No member may accumulate more than 35 hours to the good or fall 25 hours
    in the hole, except for extenuating circumstances that should be approved
    by the chairperson.
  <LI>
    Cancellations of sit should be made six hours in advance of sit, if possible.
  <LI>
    Out of town guests or relatives may use co-op, but the member will be charged
    for the hours as if the guest or relative were a separate family.
  <LI>
    New members will be charged one hour for the secretary if they join before
    the 20th of the month.
  <LI>
    Before terminating co-op membership, the member's balance must be brought
    to zero. If this cannot be done through sitting or gadding, hours may be
    bought or sold to other members for $1 per hour. Both members' records are
    then adjusted for the bought/sold hours.
  <LI>
    Terminating members will continue to be charged for secretary hours until
    they officially notify chairperson of termination and bring their balance
    to zero. Therefore, termination should be planned prior to the end of the
    month to limit secretary hour accumulation.
  <LI>
    Members must keep accurate daily records of their sitting and gadding. A
    convenient way to do this is to write the information on a calendar so it
    is readily available to report to the secretary at the end of the month.
    At least keep the information until the secretary calls back with your balance,
    in case errors have been made.
  <LI>
    It is the reponsibility of every member of the co-op to be sure you would
    recommend any potential member before suggesting they notify the chairperson
    regarding joining.
  <LI>
    It is advisable that members carry liability insurance, as covered by most
    homeowners' or renters' insurance policies, to cover the expense of injury
    or accident to other children in your home.
