  Dave's Macaroni and Cheese
</H1>
<P>
This recipe serves about 6, but it's easily doubled or tripled for potluck
dinners and such. It's a reliable crowd-pleaser, especially for crowds of
children. I started making it because I wanted something as easy to make
as the macaroni and cheese dinners that come in a&nbsp;box (for example the
one made by a company whose name begins with K), but I wanted to use fresh,
real cheddar cheese instead of the powder that comes in the little packet
and has all those polysyllabic ingredients in it. My apologies for those
of the SI persuasion--I have not translated this recipe into metric units.
<TABLE CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR VALIGN="Top">
    <TD><B>Noodles:</B></TD>
    <TD>16 oz. elbow macaroni &nbsp;<BR>
      2 qt. water<BR>
      1/2 Tbsp. salt
      <P>
    </TD>
    <TD><B>Cheese Mix:</B></TD>
    <TD>2 cups grated cheddar cheese<BR>
      1/4 cup milk<BR>
      1/4 tsp. paprika<BR>
      1/4 tsp. salt<BR>
      1/8 tsp. pepper</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Boil salted water, add noodles, and cook <I>al dente.</I>
<P>
While noodles are cooking, grate the cheese and mix the remaining ingredients
into it.
<P>
Drain the noodles, return them to the pot while they're still hot, and stir
in the cheese mix so that it melts on the noodles.
<P>
My wife tells me I'm uncouth, but I usually serve it right out of the pot.
It's good to serve something green with your macaroni and cheese. Salad or
steamed vegetables are good choices. Lime Jello is another option, I suppose.
If you want to liven the macaroni and cheese up, you can slice up cooked
wieners and add them to it after it's cooked.
<P>
Another variation arose in the days when I shared a house with housemates
who tended to mooch my food. The liberal addition of chili powder, cayenne
pepper, or Tabasco Sauce scares off all but the most intrepid. Of course,
it all becomes rather pointless if you make it so hot you can't eat it yourself.
<P>
Bon appetit!
