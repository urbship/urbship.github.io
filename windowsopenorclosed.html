<H1> Open the Windows or Run the AC?</H1>
<p>This summer, I'm going to try to tweet regularly in the evening to report on 
  our cooling strategy for the night. We will be deciding between two choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>close the windows and run the central air conditioner all night, or</li>
  <li>open the windows all night and turn the air conditioner off. </li>
</ul>
<H3> Background<BR>
</H3>
<p>We installed central air a couple of years ago, because at least one of us 
  works in the home all day, and during the hot, humid part of Ontario's summer 
  it was hard to be productive. Our house does have lots of windows that open, 
  so we can get good cross-ventilation. Many of the rooms also have ceiling fans. 
  On the worst days, though, it wasn't enough.</p>
<p>There are times in an Ottawa summer when the nights are cool and the days are 
  hot. I was wondering how often - and how well - it would work to open the windows 
  at night, bring the temperature down, and then close up in the morning. Presumably 
  if the conditions were right, the air conditioner would have less work to do 
  the next day. Not always, though. If it's humid all night, even if it's cool, 
  the house will get loaded up with moisture by morning. Then the next day the 
  air conditioner will have more work to do removing the moisture than you saved 
  by lowering the temperature. You don't want that.</p>
<p>Clearly the moisture in the air is a huge factor. The moisture in the air contributes 
  to what's called the latent load on an air conditioner, whereas the simple dry-bulb 
  temperature measures the sensible load. In Ottawa it's not at all unusual for 
  the latent load to be larger than the sensible load on some days.</p>
<p>So how do you decide when the open-windows strategy will work and when it will 
  be a mistake?</p>
<h3> What Am I Doing?<br>
</h3>
<p>The measure of energy content of air - including both temperature and moisture 
  content - is called enthalpy. Enthalpy turns out to be a reasonable way to make 
  this decision. The energy that has to be removed from air to change it from 
  30&deg;C and 70% humidity to 25&deg;C and 50% humidity can be calculated by 
  comparing the enthalpies at those two points. If the outside air coming in at 
  night is cooler but moister than the air inside, you can look at the change 
  in enthalpy to find out if you're making a net improvement or making things 
  worse. If you make things worse, the air conditioner will have more work to 
  do in the morning when you close up and ask it to bring the house to comfortable 
  working conditions.</p>
<p>I have a spreadsheet that estimates the work the air conditioner will do under 
  both strategies. One strategy involves the air conditioner working all night 
  to maintain conditions and then continuing to work the next day. The other one 
  has the air conditioner shut off all night, but then it has to start with whatever 
  conditions the house will have in the morning, bring it to comfort conditions 
  and then maintain that for the day. The spreadsheet estimates which choice will 
  use less energy. All I have to do is click a button to copy the hour-by-hour 
  temperature and humidity forecast from a website into my spreadsheet. Then the 
  spreadsheet automatically updates the calculation. Each evening I plan to try 
  and post the recommended cooling strategy for my house.</p>
<H3> Your House is Different</H3>
<P> Your mileage may differ:
<UL>
  <LI> Your temperature setpoints may be different from ours. We usually let the 
    temperature float up to 26&deg;C in the afternoon (unless we can't stand it), 
    set it to 25&deg;C in the morning and evening, and bring it down to 24&deg;C 
    overnight. That's based on the times when electric rates are high, medium, 
    and low in Ontario. Keeping the temperature cooler at night does several things: 
    it &quot;pre-cools&quot; the home so that less power is needed to cool it 
    in the heat of the day, it makes use of more cooling energy when rates are 
    low, and it makes for comfortable sleeping temperatures. Allowing the temperature 
    to float up a bit during the hottest part of the day provides relief to the 
    utility during its peak load period. We think <a href="https%7C//hydroottawa.com/">Hydro 
    Ottawa</a> probably likes that.
  <LI>Your house may behave differently than ours does. Our house was built in 
    1962. It has good windows and doors and extra insulation in the attic, but 
    the walls are poorly insulated. Depending on how well-insulated your house 
    is, your air conditioner may take more or less energy to maintain a constant 
    temperature than ours does. That would change the comparison between the energy 
    needed to maintain the cooling setpoint all night and the energy needed to 
    catch up in the morning if you've had the windows open. (For the HVAC geeks 
    out there, I ran a series of experiments to estimate the time constant of 
    our house, to try to get this comparison reasonably close. 
  <LI>Your air conditioner may behave differently from ours. Ours seems to do 
    a pretty good job of bringing the humidity down to around 50% in the normal 
    course of bringing the house to the desired temperature. Air conditioners 
    that are oversized don't tend to control humidity well, because their runtime 
    is too short (they reach the temperature too quickly and there isn't enough 
    time for water to collect on the cooling coils). If your air conditioner is 
    oversized, humidity will have less effect on your air conditioner energy, 
    but you will also be less comfortable. [As a side note, if you run your fan 
    continuously during the summer, your air conditioner will do an extremely 
    poor job of controlling humidity. To get the moisture out of the air, you 
    need the air to stop moving across the coils when the air conditioner cycles 
    off. That allows the moisture to drip into the condensate pan and run down 
    the drain. If you keep the fan going, the moisture that collected on the coils 
    will just get blown back into your house and the air conditioner will have 
    to collect it all over again. Set your fan on &quot;auto&quot; in the summer.]
  <LI>You may have more or less cross-ventilation than we do. With our windows 
    open, our house typically gets to about 2&deg;C above the outside temperature 
    by morning. Then it bottoms out and, as the day begins to warm, the inside 
    temperature begins to rise, too. If you have fewer operable windows, your 
    indoor temperature may not get as close to the outside temperature before 
    it starts to warm up.

<H3>Tweets </H3>
<P> Watch for tweets this summer under the Twitter handle @daveushipley. I will 
  probably use a few hashtags, too. #CoolOttawa and #WindowsOpenOrClosed seem 
  promising. #OttawaWindowsOpenOrClosed is not in use at the moment, so I may 
  claim that one as well.
