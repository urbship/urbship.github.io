<H1> Cinnamon Swirl Bread</H1>

<p>The cinnamon swirl bread is a simpler loaf than the sourdough. No starter, 
  for one thing. Here's the recipe I ended up with. Sorry I haven't put in the 
  metric translations yet.
<H2>Starting the Loaf in the Machine</H2>

<p>I start the loaf in our bread machine. Add the following ingredients to the 
  machine (in this order):</p>

<UL>
  <LI>1 2/3 cup skim milk (buttermilk may work even better, but I don't usually 
    have it in the house)
  <LI>4 tsp. oil
  <LI>6 tbsp. sugar
  <LI>1 1/2 tsp. salt
  <LI>4 1/2 cups white flour
  <LI>1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
  <LI>2 tsp. active dry yeast
</UL>

<p>Program the “Home Made” cycle on the bread machine to preheat for 30 minutes, 
  knead for 15 minutes, let the bread rise for 90 minutes, and then STOP. Start 
  the machine. When it gets to the kneading stage, take a peek a couple of times 
  to make sure it has the right amount of moisture (flour varies). Otherwise you 
  can go do other things while the machine does its stuff.</p>

<h2>When the machine is done . . . </h2>

<p>Find a ceramic or glass bowl that’s the shape you want. Spray the bowl with 
  cooking spray.</p>

<p>Remove the dough from the bread machine and plop it onto a well-floured board. 
  Roll it out with a rolling pin until it is an oblong shape about 2 cm thick. 
  Sprinkle the whole top evenly with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 tsp. cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll it up from one end, and then – I don’t know how to describe this (and 
  I'm not very good at it) – tuck one end of the roll in and stretch the other 
  end over. Then plop it seam side up into the bowl. Drape a towel over top.</p>

<p>Turn the oven on hot for 1 minute. Turn it off again. Put
the bowl of dough into the oven and let it rise for around an hour.</p>

<p>Take the bowl out, and put a baking stone into the oven. I use a pizza stone, 
  but lots of other things will work. Preheat to 350 F. </p>

<p>When the oven is hot, sprinkle some corn meal onto the pizza stone. Turn the 
  dough out of the bowl and put it on the pizza stone. I find a peel a useful 
  tool for this step. The seam side should now be down. Bake for about 30 minutes 
  or until golden brown. Remove and place on a rack to cool.</p>
<h2>Glazing</h2>
<p>While the loaf is in the oven, heat up the following ingredients for the glaze:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 tbsp. water</li>
  <li>1 tbsp. honey</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp. cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as the loaf comes out of the oven and is on the cooling rack, brush 
  the top and sides evenly with glaze. Let the loaf cool for at least 1/2 hour 
  before eating.</p>

<H2>Enjoy</H2>

<p>This bread makes a nice treat for special occasions or potlucks. Some people 
  say I should add raisins. That might be nice, but I like it the way it is.
