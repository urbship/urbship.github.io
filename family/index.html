  Welcome to the Urban Shipley Family Page

<P>
This page is intended for our friends and family to check out the latest
pictures of the kids and find out what we're up to. We're not very interested
in conveying this information to strangers. If you do not know us, and got
to this site by accident somehow, please

<h3>You may have a number of questions about Urban Shipleys. Perhaps they will 
  be answered below in our IAQs (Infrequently Asked Questions): <br>
</h3>
<table  border="1">
  <tr align="top"> 
    <td><b>What is an Urban Shipley?</b></td>
    <td>The Urban Shipleys came into being when Dave Shipley and Ruth Urban got 
      married. The compound name &quot;Urban Shipley&quot; contains a hidden source 
      of conflict. Shipley is an old Yorkshire name that means "a shelter for 
      sheep" (Dave's ancestors were apparently sheep thieves), but Urban means 
      "of or pertaining to the city." Therefore, our name means "urban sheep shed." 
      In most municipalities, we are therefore a zoning violation. Oh, the humanity! 
    </td>

  <tr align="top"> 
    <td><b>How long have there been Urban Shipleys?</b></td>
    <td> The Urban Shipley combination was created on 1 August 1992. Ruth and 
      Dave celebrated their thirtieth anniversary on 1 August 2022. Dave thinks 
      those <a href="https://ideas.hallmark.com/articles/anniversary-ideas/anniversary-gifts-by-year/">charts 
      that tell you what kind of gift you're supposed to buy</a> for which anniversary 
      are kind of silly, so he likes to use the Periodic Table. According to that 
      theory, the thirtieth was the Zinc Anniversary. For more information 
      on zinc, please feel free to consult this fine <a href="http://www.webelements.com/index.html">on-line 
      Periodic Table</a>. Gifts and celebrations can get interesting with this 
      system. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen were easy - carbon-based life forms 
      all involve those elements, so Dave gave Ruth chocolates. To celebrate our 
      Fluorine Anniversary, we went out for a nice dinner . . . and brushed our 
      teeth afterwards. Since then, we've gotten a bit lax. To celebrate neon, 
      we failed to go to Vegas. Dave was a bit more successful with the Sodium 
      Anniversary: he found some salt with the brand name &quot;Our Very Own.&quot; 
      It was very romantic. For the Magnesium Anniversary, we failed to get new 
      mag wheels for the station wagon. Our plans for aluminum also got foiled. 
      The Silicon Anniversary was going to be easy: Dave was going to re-do the 
      caulking around the bathtub. But he didn't. For Argon we could have replaced 
      our windows, but we had already done so years earlier. For calcium, I think 
      we had some ice cream. Zinc should have really galvanized us into action,
      but we didn't really do anything unusual. We're not that great at this.</td>
