<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> We Bought a House!</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="wholehousefront.jpeg" width="494" height="305" align="middle"> 
<P>We finally bought a house on 28 June 2002, located at 951 Kincaid Court in 
  Ottawa. There are more pictures below. It's across the street from the house 
  we <a href="kincaid.html">failed to buy</a> in November of 2001, so we obviously 
  still like the location. The house needed a fair amount of work, but it was 
  priced accordingly, so we felt we could manage. We have been supervising contractors 
  and doing a lot of work ourselves, and some things are now done, but we still 
  have more ahead of us. Although most things have gone okay, the whole process 
  has been stressful and overwhelming. We really wish we could have bought a house 
  that didn't need this kind of work, but we couldn't find one we could afford. 
<P> Here are the basics: 
<UL>
  <LI>four bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs 
  <LI>living room, dining room, and kitchen on the main floor
  <LI>a rec room, bathroom and utility room in the basement
  <LI>oversized attached garage
  <LI>big corner lot with mature trees
  <LI>oil heat, no air conditioning
</UL>
<p>Here's what we have done so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>removed carpets and had hardwood floors refinished 
  <li>had the main bathroom completely gutted and renovated (all that remains 
    to do is put up some kind of shelving thing on one wall) 
  <li>had the famous kitchen bench ripped out (see photo below) and replaced a 
    wall at the other end of the kitchen that had water damage from the bathroom 
    above - while we were having that done, we decided to have the countertop 
    and sink replaced and also replaced the existing dishwasher with the one we 
    brought from Madison 
  <li>had every window in the house replaced 
  <li>replaced three outside doors - two at the front and back of the breezeway 
    and the third connecting the house and garage (Dave did all three and still 
    has a bit of trim to finish on them) 
  <li>had the interior painted 
  <li>purchased new washer and dryer (we got a horizontal axis washer and a gas 
    dryer) 
  <li>had the rental electric water heater replaced with a non-rental gas water 
    heater 
  <li>Dave <a href="../images2002/goingtochina.jpeg">dug a big hole</a> beside 
    the garage to diagnose a growing crack in the brick work. Then in the spring 
    of 2003 we had the foundation repaired, after removing a nearby tree that 
    likely contributed to the problem. 
  <li>Then we had the garage roof replaced. 
  <li>Then we had the soffits and fascia boards replaced. 
  <li>Then we got new gutters (eavestroughs, they call them in Canada) and downspouts.
  <li>After a couple of years of work, we have finally replaced the front entry 
    door and added matching shutters.
</ul>
<p>Dave built a play structure for the kids in the yard. We also have lots of 
  landscaping plans, some of which are completed and others underway. </p>
<p>Here's what we would love to do next year (if we can stretch the finances that 
  far): </p>
<ul>
  <li>new stoop, maybe with pillars 
  <li>new driveway 
  <li>new floor in the entryway and kitchen areas
  <li>rework of the electrical system (the panel is all fuses and the kitchen 
    doesn't meet code, among other things)
  <li>new furnace (to do our bit for reducing GHG emissions)
  <li>maybe a new bannister for the staircase 
</ul>
