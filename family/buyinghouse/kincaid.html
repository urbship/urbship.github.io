We're Not Buying a House! (Curses)

<h2><font color="#FF0000">News Flash - We are buying a house on Kincaid, but not 
  this one!</font> </h2>
<P>We made an offer in November 2001 on a house located at 960 Kincaid Court in 
  Ottawa. We liked a lot of things about it, including the location, the amount 
  of space, and the yard. Of course, we started imagining all the things we would 
  do with the rooms, renovations we would do, and so on. Unfortunately, the inspection 
  was a huge disappointment. There are unexpected issues with the foundation of 
  the house, the overall structure of the garage, and the furnace. We knew we'd 
  be re-doing floors, having the place painted, and replacing a roof in a couple 
  of years. However, this is more than we're ready to deal with. 
<P> 
The garage alone probably needs about $12,000 worth of work, including foundation, walls, roof
framing, and new shingles. There are deposits of oily soot on walls in various rooms that appear
to have been caused by a furnace (this one? the previous one? who can know?). Probably to deal
with that properly would require switching to a gas furnace, washing the walls with tri-sodium
phosphate, and then painting. If you just washed and painted the walls, you might be doing the
same thing again in two years. Then there's the house foundation. We're guessing the footing is
cracked in two places near one corner (the back corner on the opposite end from the garage). 
There are two cracks in the foundation wall that run right up through the bricks, and the slab
is also cracked. 
<P>
We're really disapointed, because the house has lots going for it: 
<UL><LI>four bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, 
<LI>living room, dining room, kitchen and powder room on the main floor, and 
<LI>a rec room, bathroom and bedroom in the basement. </UL>It's at the end of a
cul-de-sac, with a pie-shaped lot. There's a fireplace in the living room and a wood stove in the
basement, but the main heating system is forced air oil. It has central air conditioning. There
is oak hardwood on most of the floors, and even the carpeted floors have oak underneath.
<P>
We feel sad for the current owners, who are elderly and need to sell in order to move into 
a condo that's easier for them to deal with. They have lived there since the house was 
built in 1962, and raised 5 children there. I'm sure it is hard for them to leave as it is, 
and these issues are likely going to come as a shock to them.
