Dear friends and family,
<P>
Years have passed since we last wrote to many of you. In fact, since our
last newsletter went out, there is one more of us than there were before,
and he's two years old already. Some of you have heard about him, but some
of you haven't. We actually had a newsletter more or less written about a
year ago, but never managed to finish it and get it mailed out. Only a few
people who knew about our family website saw it.
<P>
Most parts of our lives are as they were. We still live in the same house
and work at the same place. The most exciting elements of our lives, and
the ones that have changed the most, are the children.
<P> <IMG SRC="oldimages/bensling.jpeg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=300 ALT="Image of Ben the day after birth"> 
  Benjamin James Urban Shipley was born 17 May 1996 at 12:19 a.m. at Meriter Hospital 
  in Madison, Wisconsin. He weighed 3.6 kg (8 pounds) and was 52 cm (20.5 inches) 
  long. That's a little less than a fifth of the weight of a curling rock and 
  a little less than twice the diameter of a curling rock. 
<P> <IMG SRC="oldimages/bentrike.jpeg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=300 ALT="Image of Ben on a Trike"> 
  Now he's walking and running and trying to learn how to jump. He talks a lot, 
  and manages to get his point across more than half the time. He can be very 
  serious, but he has a beautiful smile. He is a connoisseur of vehicles (both 
  real and toy) and is interested in any new riding experience he can get. His 
  life list now includes strollers, cars, bicycles, bike trailers, tricycles, 
  wagons, sleds, buses, trains, airplanes, subways, streetcars, elevators, escalators, 
  canoes, and ferries. With his friend Bic, he is a founding member of TEWBS, 
  or Truck Enthusiasts With Big Sisters. 
<P>
And speaking of big sisters, Rachel is now five years old. She's full of
questions, some of which send us scrambling for encyclopedia, atlases, and
websites. She has a passion for art projects, imaginative games, books and
theatre. Rachel has a favourite babysitter who acts in a group of young people
who put on Shakespearean plays, and Rachel and her dad have attended two
of them--The Winter's Tale and Twelfth Night. It's amazing what children
as young as seven can do with Shakespeare's language if they're well coached,
and Rachel's sufficiently interested that she thinks she might want to try
it in a couple of years.
<P> Rachel is also learning to play the piano. After a&nbsp;false start with private 
  lessons, we've been attending group lessons, which also include listening and 
  singing exercises. &nbsp;Because parents are expected to help with practicing, 
  daily music has become a family event. Ben particularly enjoys dancing to&nbsp;the 
  "music and movement" pieces. <IMG SRC="oldimages/recital.jpeg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=300 ALT="Image of Rachel in her first recital"> 
  Rachel had her first recital in March. With memories of his own childhood recitals, 
  her dad felt pretty nervous watching her take the stage, but Rachel was nowhere 
  near as nervous as he was, and the recital went wonderfully. Rachel's (Shipley) 
  grandparents were delighted to have been able to be there. 
<P>
Instead of sending Rachel off to full-day kindergarten this fall, we're going
to try homeschooling. There are some strong local support groups for parents
and kids involved in homeschooling, and many community resources available.
We've been enjoying teaching and learning along with Rachel so far, so we're
looking forward to doing so slightly more formally.
<P>
One thing that makes homeschooling a bit more feasible for us is our job
sharing arrangement. We both still work at the Energy Center of Wisconsin,
Ruth at 50% time and Dave at 70%. This probably limits our chance for advancement
somewhat, but we still have the opportunity to work on some interesting projects.
We both love the time we get to spend with our kids, and that is certainly
the main reason we give for job sharing, but to be honest neither of us wants
to go back to full-time work even after the kids leave home.
<P> <IMG SRC="oldimages/benrach.jpeg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=300 ALT="Halloween"> 
  We still live in the same house, though it slowly evolves as we paint things, 
  have rooms wallpapered, and replace various things that break. The Crestwood 
  area continues to offer an amazingly rich neighborhood life--Ruth is now the 
  editor of the neighborhood newsletter and Dave is secretary to the neighborhood 
  board. This is apparently the oldest housing cooperative in the U.S., dating 
  back to the 1920s. Careful management of proceeds from land sales over the years 
  has provided the association with a fund whose income finances half a dozen 
  wonderful social events each year--an egg hunt in spring, a 4th of July parade 
  and picnic, a Halloween bonfire, and so on. When we take a walk on a summer 
  evening, it often becomes a round of chats and visits. 
<P>
Dave still curls and Ruth remains remarkably patient with this odd foible.
He isn't spending enough time on the ice to get much better these days
(especially in August), but he still likes it. Off the ice, he's been a major
contributor to the curling club's website, posting league results every week
during the season. Recently, he was asked to become secretary to
the&nbsp;curling club board, so that's another set of minutes to get out
every month. &nbsp;
<P>
Rachel has suggested that Ruth's hobby is housecleaning, but she's trying
to prove Rachel wrong. In addition to doing the neighborhood newsletter,
she was a regular in Madison (Quaker) Meeting's nursery last year. During
the winter, her "hobby" was reactivating her computer skills for an intranet
project at work. &nbsp;She's currently trying to decide how she's going to
spend all of the "free" evenings she'll have coming to her during Dave's
curling season--maybe music lessons?
<P>
Since the kids feel like the most newsworthy parts of our lives these days,
we'll put in just a few more kid pictures. The one on the left just below
was taken at our neighborhood autumn picnic, called Crestfest, in September
1996. The picture in the middle is in early December of 1996. Rachel was
talking to her grandma &nbsp;(Shipley) on the phone. The one on the right
is Ben swinging at a playground in New Hampshire on our summer vacation in
1997. Bottom left is Rachel dressing up in the basement at her Urban
grandparents' house in New Hampshire in 1997. Bottom right is Rachel with
her cousins Ellen (left) and Michael (right) at her Shipley grandparents'
house in Ottawa. Ellen and Michael are two of Dave's brother Kevin's children.

<P>
We now have a website of our own, so we'll be posting this newsletter there
at the same time as we start mailing it out. If you're reading this on paper,
you might want to check out the color pictures on the web.
<P>
Well, that's it for another year (or two?). We hope this finds you well.
<P>
love to all,
