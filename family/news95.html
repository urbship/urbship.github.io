Dear friends and family,
<P>
To an outsider, our lives over the past year and a half might seem uneventful.
We didn't get married, none of us travelled overseas, we didn't have any
more kids, and we didn't buy a house. Dave was not appointed vice president
of his company; Ruth didn't successfully run for city council while at the
same time inventing the world's first 3-D fax machine (so I guess she won't
be able to fax you some home-made brownies when you get yours). Rachel has
not mastered the violin and did not give her first recital at 17 months.
<P>
On another level, specifically one that's quite close to the floor, things
have changed a lot. Rachel [at 20 months] is now toddling, climbing, and
exploring everything. She learns two or three words a day and can sometimes
string a short phrase together. We realize we're repeating a pattern that
most of the human race has gone through before, but it's new to us. There's
a real joy in the vicarious sense of discovery we feel through Rachel. A
small child also seems to ground one much more firmly in the present. Getting
down on hands and knees with her and looking at a fallen leaf is an entirely
"here and now" event.
<P>
Oddly, we've seen a lot more of our parents since Rachel was born. We're
alternating Christmases between Ruth's parents and Dave's parents, but both
sets appear for flying visits from time to time in between.
<P>
Our summer vacation took us to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
Admittedly, these are not conventional tourist meccas, but we had our reasons.
Rachel hadn't met any of Dave's various relatives who live in Western Canada,
and Ruth had never seen the area of Canada where Dave grew up. In Winnipeg,
we stayed for a couple of days in the apartment of Dave's grandmother on
his dad's side (whom the family calls Nanoo). Then Dave's parents arrived
in Winnipeg and moved in with Nanoo while we moved out to stay with family
friends, the Standings. They were wonderful hosts and we really enjoyed the
chance to visit. We managed to connect with a lot of people in Winnipeg,
including Dave's mother's birth mother and her family. We're grateful to
Dave's Uncle Searle and Aunt Liz for arranging a wonderful dinner.
<P>
In Saskatoon we also had a chance to visit with old friends of Dave's (and
his Aunt Sheila and her partner Art, who drove all the way from Edmonton
to see Rachel). We stayed with Dave's bachelor friend Gary, who found the
presence of a one-year-old a bit mind-boggling. We were on an ultimately
unsuccessful quest to find saskatoon-berry pie like Mom used to make (need
Mom for that, I guess), and a more successful quest to see some of the prairie
landscape that still makes Dave homesick.
<P>
This past Christmas we managed to see both sets of Rachel's grandparents
in one trip. We were in Ottawa for Christmas itself, with Dave's parents,
his three siblings, their various spouses, Dave's neice, his aunt and uncle,
and two grandmothers. The groaning board groaned under the weight of turkey
for 15. Rachel enjoyed playing with her cousin Ellen (who's two months younger),
but the feeling wasn't universally mutual. We need to do some work on the
concepts of "gentle" and "using our inside voice." One highlight of the visit
was a croquet match held at a nearby indoor facility. Dave's parents have
taken up the sport in a major way, and it's actually a pretty interesting
game when played with good equipment using the official rules. Dave's not
yet ready to switch over from curling, however.
<P>
For logistical (i.e., money) reasons, we flew from Madison to Syracuse instead
of Ottawa, and rented a car to zip across the border and back. (Airlines
are crazy--we're hoping that the "open skies" agreement makes Madison to
Ottawa a two plan hop instead of the current three.) That gave us the opportunity
to visit with Ruth's grandmother and cousins, who live near Syracuse, and
her parents, who were out visiting for Christmas. That was Ruth and Rachel's
second visit to Syracuse for the year--the first was in May, a few months
before Ruth's grandfather died.
<P>
Back at home, we are back to what we call normal. Those of you with good
memories will recall that David was hired to take Ruth's job when she quit
to stay home with Rachel. In July of this past year, we worked out a job-sharing
arrangement. Ruth works 50%, while Dave works 75% (enough to get us all health
benefits). We share an office and are both project managers, but usually
manage different projects. Of course, work spills over into home life--we
discuss projects and office politics right before we drift off to sleep at
night, and make and take phone calls from home when we need to move projects
along. The payoff is the time we have to spend with Rachel, and the balance
(or is it lack of additional craziness?) that this arrangement gives us both.
<P>
We overlap at work two mornings a week, during which time Rachel is at
daycare.Finding good daycare for a kid under two was an eye-opening experience.
We've finally found a set-up that we're comfortable with, and Rachel seems
to be enjoying hanging out with small kids and trying new activities while
we're at work those two mornings.
<P>
Meanwhile there are lots of projects to keep us busy around the house. We've
got enough ideas to last the next five years at least--and not much "free
time" to pull them off.
<P>
We haven't done much skiing this year (less snow than last year), but Dave
has been curling as much as twice a week. He's still bad enough that improvement
is easy and tangible, but good enough to make the occasional good shot. It's
not great for aerobic points, but it's probably doing a little to keep him
from becoming a total blob. Meanwhile Ruth is pondering what to do with all
of the "nights out" that she figures are coming to her.
<P>
love to all,
<P>
Dave and Ruth
