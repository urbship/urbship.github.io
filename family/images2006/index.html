    <TD COLSPAN=2><b>We went to New Hampshire for our usual one-week post-Christmas 
      visit with the Urbans at their house on the shore of Lake Pawtuckaway in 
      New Hampshire. We found the skating rather poor this year, so Rachel and 
      I decided to go swimming. We went two mornings in a row - the 28th and 29th 
      of December. These pictures were taken on the 29th by Ruth's dad, Will Urban. 
      The next day the surface froze, so we didn't go swimming any more.</b></TD>

    <TD>It was about 7 a.m. The air temperature was -4 C. The water was probably 
      about freezing, because there was ice floating around in the cove.</TD>

      very long!</TD>

    <TD COLSPAN=2><B>We went to Wisconsin this year for our vacation. We're just 
      starting to post pictures of that trip. Here's one that we thought the Tanzania 
      Greenlers might enjoy. </B></TD>

    <TD>This is a melon that Thomas grew. He called it Elliemelon, because Ellie 
      loves watermelon. It grew to 28 pounds before it got eaten.</TD>
