<P> We moved to Canada the summer of 2000. We sold <A HREF="images2000-2001/madhouse.jpeg">our 
  house</A> on 10 August, 2000. <A HREF="images2000-2001/truck2.jpeg">The movers 
  came to get our stuff </A>on the 9th, but not everything fit, so about a quarter 
  of it ended up in a Madison warehouse to await the departure of another truck 
  a couple of weeks later. We climbed in the cars for the three-day trip to Ottawa 
  on the 12th. We packed up the computer the night of the 8th, so we went out 
  of e-mail contact. Dave got e-mail at work as of the 16th, but we didn't get 
  it at home until the 26th. Our contact info is below. 
<P>
We have both started work at an Ottawa consulting firm called
Marbek. Dave started the 16th of August
and Ruth started right after Labour Day. The company does energy and
environmental work, about 2/3 of it domestically in Canada and the other
1/3 overseas. Dave's been in contact with them since 1992, and has always
been interested in the firm.&nbsp;The work they do is very interesting and
so far we are really enjoying the work environment. We are delighted to report
that we are again working under a similar <A HREF="../jobs.html">job
sharing</A> arrangement to the one we had in Madison.
<P> We are currently renting a house (and <A HREF="images2000-2001/otthouse.jpeg">this 
  is what it looks like</A>). We plan to rent for a while until we know the market 
  well enough to buy a house. Our new address information is:

<P> Keep watching this space for updates. We'll be moving again when we buy a 
  house. We expect our web address will stay the same when we move again. Please
