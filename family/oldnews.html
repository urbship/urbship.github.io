<h2>Newsletters from 1995 through 1998 (most recent first)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our <a href="news98.html">1998 newsletter</a> was posted when we mailed 
    it out.&nbsp;The mail version and the web version were the same, except you 
    web-users get to see the pictures in colour. One warning, though: unless you 
    have a fast web connection, you might want to turn off your images before 
    you load this page. It contains 10 jpeg images, with an average size of about 
    50k each. Each of these images is in the list below, so you may find it more 
    convenient to look at the images individually and then read the text of the 
    newsletter without them. It's up to you. 
  <li> draft version of our <a href="news97.html">1997 newsletter</a>,&nbsp;which 
    never made it into print, unfortunately. This also has jpeg images in it. 
    The average size of the images is about 70k each (I wasn't as good at shrinking 
    them then). Again, you may want to look at them separately and read the text 
    of the newsletter with your images turned off. 
  <li> Ben's birth <a href="announce.html">announcement</a>, including a family 
    photo taken in June 1996 (a photo that's also in the 1997 newsletter) 
  <li> our <a href="news95.html">1995 newsletter</a>, text only 
</ul>
