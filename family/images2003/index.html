<h2>Images From 2003 </h2>
<ul>
  <li>We have posted <a href="rachelsanta2003.jpeg">Rachel's</a> and <a href="bensanta2003.jpeg">Ben's</a> 
    letters to Santa for this year. 
  <li>Rachel is in the Ottawa Children's Choir this year. They are practicing 
    for a performance at the National Arts Centre in a few weeks. This rehearsal 
    took place with several other choirs preparing for the same series of concerts, 
    at a large Catholic Church. Here is a broad view showing about <a href="choirpractice1.jpeg">half 
    of the overall choir</a> that was there, and here is a closer view of <a href="choirpractice2.jpeg">Rachel's 
    group</a>. The Choir performed at the national Remembrance Day ceremony on 
    11 November. I couldn't get very good shots of them actually singing, but 
    here is a <a href="choirwalking.jpeg">picture of them walking</a> to the Conference 
    Centre to have a break after their sound check. Here is another shot, with 
    a <a href="choirwalking2.jpeg">couple of choir members</a> walking - members 
    of the band are in the background. This is about the best shot I could get 
    of the <a href="choirsinging.jpeg">choir singing</a>, from where I was standing. 
  <li>Rachel and Dave each carved <a href="pumpkins2003.jpeg">pumpkins</a> for 
    Halloween this year. Rachel's is on the upper pumpkin; Dave's is the lower. 
    We hope you can figure out who <a href="punkinheadbush.jpeg">Dave's pumpkin</a> 
    is supposed to be. It was the scariest thing he could think of to carve. 
  <li>Ben dressed up as a <a href="skeleton2003.jpeg">skeleton</a> this year. 
    He glowed in the dark. He also found three skeletons to hang up outside. Rachel 
    dressed up as a <a href="witch2003.jpeg">witch</a>. 
  <li>In September, we went to the Rockies, and took lots of pictures: 
    <ul>
      <li>Here is <a href="rachelsice.jpeg">Rachel, holding some ice</a> from 
        the melt pond below Mount Edith Cavell</li>
      <li>On the clearest (least smoky) day we had, we went up the Jasper Sky 
        Tram and hiked up to <a href="whistlerspeak.jpeg">Whistlers Peak</a>. 
        Depending on your screen, you might be able to see Mount Robson as a little 
        white point sticking up to the right of Dave. It is 75 km away.</li>
      <li>This picture, also taken on Whistlers Peak, shows Ruth and Rachel sitting 
        together with <a href="kerkeslin.jpeg">Mount Kerkeslin</a> in the background.</li>
      <li>We hiked up part of the <a href="malignecanyon.jpeg">Maligne Canyon</a>.</li>
      <li>We also went to the Miette Hot Springs, which has the hottest water 
        of any hot springs in the parks (51 C - <a href="ouchitshot.jpeg">hurry 
        up and take the picture</a>, Dad!) In fact, we went twice. Dave found 
        it sobering that the pool he swam in last time he was there now <a href="mietteruin.jpeg">looks 
        like this</a>. It's the first time he's been personally associated with 
        a ruin.</li>
      <li>Here we are <a href="glacier.jpeg">standing on the Athabasca Glacier</a>, 
        which has retreated hundreds of feet since I last saw it in 1984.</li>
      <li>We spent a whole day <a href="kidsonwaterfallday.jpeg">looking for waterfalls</a> 
        all over Jasper Park. We saw <a href="stanleycreekfalls.jpeg">some nice 
        falls</a> on the Stanley Creek trail.</li>
      <li>On the way back, we saw a group of <a href="goats.jpeg">mountain goats</a>, 
        right next to the road. These are usually much more elusive than the bighorn 
        sheep, so we were really lucky to see them this close.</li>
      <li>In Jasper we stayed in a cabin in a place called Pine Bungalows. There 
        was a group of elk hanging around the area, and we heard <a href="elk.jpeg">this 
        guy</a> bugling most evenings.</li>
      <li>After a week in Jasper, we moved on to Lake Louise. We met Dave's friend 
        Katja and her family for a hike. Here are <a href="kidsatlakelouise.jpeg">Ben 
        and Rachel with Eric and Stefan</a>. Here are <a href="threehikers.jpeg">Eric, 
        Stefan and Ben</a> looking back down from near the Lake Agnes Teahouse.</li>
      <li>On a rainy day, we went to <a href="takakkaw.jpeg">Takakkaw Falls</a>, 
        the tallest waterfall in Canada and apparently the third highest in the 
        world. The little group of people dressed in blue near the base of the 
        falls is Ruth, Rachel, and Ben.</li>
      <li>On another day we took a <a href="hikingtosilverton.jpeg">lovely hike</a> 
        to <a href="silvertonfalls.jpeg">Silverton Falls</a>.</li>
      <li>We went to Moraine Lake and climbed the big rock pile. Ben set <a href="benatmorainelake.jpeg">this 
        shot</a> up. Dave just pushed the button.</li>
      <li>Our last day in Banff National Park began with the <a href="banffhoodoos.jpeg">Hoodoos</a>. 
        That hike also features a beautiful view of the <a href="banffsprings.jpeg">Banff 
        Springs Hotel</a>, where Dave's mom was once a chambermaid.</li>
      <li>From there, we headed towards the Drumheller area, stopping at <a href="horseshoecanyon.jpeg">Horseshoe 
        Canyon</a> and the <a href="swingingbridge.jpeg">Star Mine Suspension 
        Bridge</a>, before finishing up our day with <a href="morehoodoos.jpeg">more 
        Hoodoos</a>.</li>
      <li>We had a wonderful visit to the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, 
        but unfortunately as we were leaving the kids were <a href="dinosaurattack.jpeg">attacked 
        by a dinosaur</a>. It's important not to <a href="benloseshishead.jpeg">lose 
        your head</a> in such situations. Shortly after, a giant T. Rex rampaged 
        through the town. <a href="trex.jpeg">Rachel narrowly escaped</a> being 
        stepped on (she's a tiny blue spot by his foot).</li>
    </ul>
  <li>In August, we went to Canadian Yearly Meeting, the annual gathering of the 
    Quakers in Canada. Three of us learned to <a href="balancing.jpeg">balance</a> 
    and build <a href="pyramid.jpeg">pyramids</a>. 
  <li>Ruth and Dave like to <a href="mountaintopnh.jpeg">climb mountains</a> on 
    their vacations - this was Mount Jackson in the White Mountains, during our 
    July visit to the Urbans' place. 
  <li>The Urbans have a <a href="ropeswing1.jpeg">rope swing</a> at their cottage. 
    Looks <a href="ropeswing2.jpeg">exciting</a>, doesn't it? 
  <li>There are some &quot;after&quot; pictures posted on the <a href="../buyinghouse/index.html">page 
    that talks about our new house</a> 
  <li><a href="iraqvigil.jpeg">Rachel and her dad singing at a peace vigil before 
    the Iraq war</a> (photo taken by Patrick Doyle of the Ottawa Citizen)
