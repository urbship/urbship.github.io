      <P ALIGN=LEFT> Dear friends and family, 
      <P> Five years have passed since we last did an Urban Shipley family newsletter. 
        We did send out brief notes when we moved to Canada in 2000, so most of 
        you heard from us then. Since then we have moved again, so it's past time 
        that we told our latest news. We'll stick mostly to events since 2000. 
        There are more pictures and other stuff posted on the Urban Shipley family 
        website (proudly serving you since 1996) than we can include here. You 
        can go look there (<a href="http://www.urbship.ca/family/index.html">http://www.urbship.ca/family/index.html</a>) 
        if you want more. 
      <P>First, the headlines, then the details: 
      <ul>
        <li>We moved to Ottawa in 2000</li>
        <li>We rented a house for a couple of years and then bought one in 2002</li>
        <li>Ruth and Dave work at a firm called Marbek, doing energy management</li>
        <li>We still job share</li>
        <li>We still home school the kids</li>
        <li>Rachel is now 10 and Ben is now 7</li>
        <li>We see Dave's family often, and it is now only a one-day drive to 
          Ruth's parents' place in New Hampshire, so we see them at least four 
          times a year</li>
        <li>We finally took a vacation to the Rocky Mountains this year</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Move</h4>
      <p>The <a href="moving.html">move</a> was part of a plan established before 
        we were even married. We were supposed to try Ruth's country for a while 
        (it turned out to be nine years) and then try Dave's. We always get asked 
        &quot;how we like it here&quot; and it's always a tough question to answer. 
        How can you compare life in two countries? Certainly life in Ottawa is 
        mostly pretty good. Our work life is significantly improved. It is wonderful 
        to be closer to both families, and we have established some friendships 
        and other good connections to the community. The homeschooling community 
        here is very supportive, and Ottawa has a rich range of cultural activities 
        and other things to do. And it's got to be the best place to ice skate 
        in the world.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Ottawa experienced a decade of 6% annual population 
        growth during the technology boom years. No city can withstand that kind 
        of growth and not show the stretch marks. It has changed a lot since Dave 
        lived here in the early 1980s. There is more traffic congestion, more 
        pollution, and fewer services of all kinds to go around (health care, 
        schools, houses - you name it). Growth has slowed recently, but not by 
        much. Compared to Madison, it is a city under stress. There are things 
        we got used to in Madison, and still miss. Above all, we still miss our 
        friends there. Our hearts will probably never complete the move - a wistfulness 
        will always remain.</p>
      <p>When we contacted people to let them know where we were, we were still 
        in that &quot;honeymoon&quot; period after a major move. Others who have 
        changed countries before will know that the toughest time comes about 
        halfway through the first year, when the excitement wears off. It's often 
        worse when you're coming back to your own country, and that was definitely 
        the case with Dave. Ben's lowest point came when he realized that he couldn't 
        have his three favourite friends attend his fifth birthday party, because 
        they all lived in Madison. Well, we all got through it, and things got 
        better.</p>

      <h4>Housing</h4>
      <p>We rented a <a href="images2000-2001/otthouse.jpeg">house</a> when we 
        first moved, because we didn't know the Ottawa housing market. When we 
        did get serious about looking for a house to buy, it took us a long time. 
        After looking for months (and driving our patient realtor crazy), it was 
        finally Rachel's networking that got us a house. Ruth got talking with 
        the mother of one of Rachel's Brownie colleagues, and learned that she 
        wanted to sell her house. It was in a nice location - across the street 
        from one we'd tried to buy before - and only 700 metres from the house 
        we were renting. It needed a lot of work, but the price was good.</p>
      <p><IMG SRC="buyinghouse/wholehousefront.jpeg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=185 ALT="Image of Urban Shipley house"> 
        We took possession at the end of June 2002, but retained our rental house 
        until the end of August. We wanted to use the overlap to start some renovations. 
        Dave started ripping out carpets so that the hardwood floors could be 
        refinished. He also started work on installing new doors at the front 
        and back of the breezeway, so that it would be possible for work crews 
        to lock their tools in the garage.</p>
      <p><img src="buyinghouse/mainbathroom.jpeg" align="LEFT" width=176 height=300 alt="Image of old bathroom"> 
        The next major project was to renovate the main bathroom (left) on the 
        second floor. We decided to have it gutted to the studs, and even had 
        a wall moved to make it larger. There was extensive water damage around 
        the bathroom, which had caused mildew damage inside the walls around the 
        tub and in the kitchen below. The whole project got a bit involved.</p>
      <p><img src="buyinghouse/newbathroom.jpeg" align="RIGHT" width=198 height=300 alt="Image of new bathroom">The 
        bathroom now looks like the photo at right. Of course, the job wasn't 
        quite finished when we moved in. In fact, we had no sink in either the 
        main bathroom or the kitchen. And then the basement toilet quit working. 
        So the only toilet we had was on the second floor and the only sink was 
        in the basement. We left to spend a week in New Hampshire.</p>
      <p>It was a while before the house really became habitable, because once 
        we got sinks, we turned around and had all the windows replaced and every 
        room painted - all in the month of October. It was overwhelming. We needed 
        to slow down and just live in the place for a while. Fortunately, winter 
        came and we cocooned.</p>
      <p><img src="buyinghouse/houseimprvwgarage.jpeg" align="LEFT" width=300 height=180 alt="Image of Urban Shipley house"> 
        This past summer, we had a few more things done, including some foundation 
        repair, a new roof on the garage, and new fascia boards, soffits, eavestroughs 
        and downspouts. Now the place looks a bit more presentable from the outside, 
        as you can see from the picture at left. We're still thinking about what 
        to do next.</p>
      <p>Anyone else who owns a house knows that the improvements never end. To 
        avoid your eyes glazing over, however, our discussion of them needs to 
        end. If you want to know more, you can read it <a href="buyinghouse/index.html">elsewhere</a> 
        on our website.</p>

    <TD COLSPAN=2> 
      <h4>Work</h4>
      <p>Ruth and Dave still work at Marbek, 
        the firm we joined when we first moved here. We both feel Marbek is a 
        great place to work. We are doing interesting work that is intended to, 
        and often does, make the world a better place. Marbek is a well-regarded 
        firm that seems to have quite a bit of influence. It is good to see, at 
        least sometimes, that the recommendations we come up with in our projects 
        actually get adopted and acted on by the governments, utilities, and other 
        organizations that hire us.</p>
      <p>Of course, no job is perfect. Anyone in consulting has experienced the 
        peaks and valleys of that world. In Ottawa, inevitably, the last few months 
        of the federal fiscal year (leading up to 31 March) are the crunch time. 
        All these clients pop out of the woodwork and realize they have a limited 
        time and not enough resources to finish all the projects they promised 
        to do during the fiscal year. It's our job to take up the slack, put in 
        the long hours, and help them get there. The good side of that is that 
        we're allowed to take some of that overtime as vacation in the (usually 
        less busy) summer. The tough part is that we have to survive it while 
        it's happening.</p>
      <p>We are still <a href="http://www.urbship.ca/jobs.html">job-sharing</a>, 
        and it still works after nearly 10 years. Dave works about 25 hours a 
        week and Ruth works about 20. It's remarkable that we have managed to 
        bring this job-sharing pattern to a new employer. After six years doing 
        it at the Energy Center of Wisconsin, we figured we had most of the bugs 
        worked out, but we're still grateful that Marbek was willing to risk trying 
        it. We think our family life is very much the better for it.</p>

    <TD COLSPAN=2> 
      <h4>School</h4>
      <p>We still homeschool our kids. Rachel is in grade five now (or fifth grade, 
        as they say in the U.S.) Ben is in grade two. We handle the basics ourselves, 
        including reading, writing, math, spelling, and topics in science, history, 
        geography and such. The kids both take piano lessons, and Rachel is in 
        a choir. They are both part of an organized swimming lesson session for 
        homeschoolers, and they are also currently taking group gymnastics classes. 
        Rachel just finished a creative writing class.</p>
      <p>French is probably our greatest challenge. The kids spend Monday mornings 
        with an Algerian woman who was formerly a French teacher. We also work 
        on it with tapes and computer software. At some point, we may have to 
        investigate options for French immersion as a family.</p>
      <p>We still have no idea how long we will homeschool. It continues to work 
        well for us as a family. Both kids are learning well, and most of the 
        time everybody gets along reasonably well as we work away at it.</p>

      <h4><img src="images2000-2001/groupshot2001dec.jpeg" align="RIGHT" width=300 height=213 alt="Image of  Shipley family">Family</h4>
      <p>We don't spend as much time on airplanes any more, because Dave's family 
        is mostly in the Ottawa area and Ruth's parents are a one day drive from 
        here. Dave's parents still live in the same Ottawa house they've had since 
        1980. His sister Elaine also lives in Ottawa with her partner Vinnie and 
        a new baby. His name is Theland (rhymes with New Zealand) and he was born 
        May 27, 2003. Dave's sister Jill lives across the river in Gatineau with 
        her husband Marc. Dave's brother Kevin lives in Kingston, two hours' drive 
        south, with his wife Carol and four children. In December of 2001, there 
        was a big photo op at the Shipley house, and we managed to get a reasonably 
        decent shot of the whole family. The only one missing is Theland, who 
        at the time was merely a very good idea.</p>
      <p><img src="images2002/benfishing.jpeg" align="LEFT" width=191 height=300 alt="Image of Ben fishing">We 
        travel to New Hampshire twice a year and Ruth's parents come here in between. 
        The Urbans have been remodelling a cottage on a lovely lake in southern 
        New Hampshire. The location is great, especially when the weather is hot 
        enough to make swimming appealing. It's a great place for fooling around 
        in boats, trying out fishing, doing puzzles, or swinging on the <img src="images2003/ropeswing2.jpeg" align="RIGHT" width=196 height=300 alt="Image of Rachel swinging">rope 
        swing. We are less than half as far from them as we were in Wisconsin, 
        even though we moved across an international border.</p>
      <h4>Travels</h4>
      <p>Since we moved to Canada, we have been on airplanes a few times. The 
        first major trip was in 2001. We went back to Wisconsin to visit all the 
        friends we had been missing (and still miss!) We were having a wonderful 
        time and beginning to feel sad about having to end our vacation and come 
        home, when suddenly we couldn't come home. Our scheduled return on the 
        13th of September became impossible in just a few minutes one horrible 
        morning. It was a grim and very strange time to be in the U.S. We were 
        lucky in many ways - we were all together, we were safe, and we were surrounded 
        by people we loved. Eventually, we made our way home by train and by bus.</p>
      <p>We didn't have a major vacation in 2002, because we were too busy buying 
        the house, supervising contractors, moving, fixing things, supervising 
        more contractors, and generally dealing with logistics.</p>
      <p>In September of 2003, we went to the Rocky Mountains, a vacation we'd 
        been wanting to do for years. We had a wonderful time, hiking, swimming 
        in hot springs, looking at waterfalls, and seeing the wonderful wildlife. 
        Unfortunately, there were some days when we could hardly see the mountains 
        because of the smoke from wildfires in British Columbia. I will stick 
        in some pictures, but in the meantime, there are <a href="images2003/index.html">lots 
        here</a>.</p>

	  <h4>Dave's Corner</h4>
      
      <p>Oddly enough, I haven't curled since I moved back to Canada, the great 
        curling country. There are lots of curling clubs here, but for some reason 
        I haven't joined one. Instead, I have been exploring a different passion 
        - singing. </p>
      <p>I joined two choirs soon after moving to Ottawa - the Ottawa Homeschooling 
        Choir and the Ottawa Community Gospel Choir. The Gospel Choir also included 
        my mom and my cousin Erinne. The Homeschooling Choir included Rachel and, 
        eventually, my dad. Quite the family singing thing.</p>
            <p>The Homeschooling Choir led me to take private voice lessons, because 
              the then director, Sylvia Larrass, is a wonderful singing teacher. 
              For various reasons, I'm not in either of the choirs any more, but 
              I'm still taking lessons, exploring what I can do as a soloist and 
              aiming to try the Grade 9 Conservatory exam in June. I'm really 
              enjoying it - I'm still at the stage where there is so much room 
              for improvement that I can notice the progress over time. There's 
              no danger that I will be giving up my day job any time soon.</p>
            <p>The house has been a major preoccupation over the last year. While 
              we have contracted out quite a few things, it seems there is a nearly 
              endless list of repairs and projects for me. The latest is a playhouse 
              for the kids. It's now a 6 foot by 6 foot platform about 5 1/2 feet 
              in the air, with a trapdoor in the middle. Next year I'll put up 
              walls and other useful features.</p>
            <p>Ruth and I have had a bread machine for a few years, and have baked 
              a lot of our own bread. We were missing a couple of kinds of bread 
              that we used to buy in Madison, but which the bread machine couldn't 
              produce. One is a crusty sourdough and the other is cinnamon swirl. 
              I set out to replicate them, making them partly with the machine 
              and partly by hand. Both are now pretty reliable recipes, and we 
              really enjoy the results.</p>
            <p>I'm still reading ridiculously large classic works of literature. 
              The <i>Complete Works of Shakespeare</i> was just the start. The 
              latest is <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> (often called <i>Remembrance 
              of Things Past</i>) by Marcel Proust. I am now in the sixth and 
              final volume, and it has been very interesting. Although the sentences 
              and paragraphs (and the whole thing) tend to be long, it is otherwise 
              an enjoyable read. Lots to think about, and, surprisingly, passages 
              that make me laugh out loud when I'm riding the bus home from work.</p>

      <h4>Rachel's Corner</h4>
      
            <p>Hi! As you might have guessed, this is Rachel. As for what I've 
              been up to, I've been taking a creative writing class (it just finished), 
              doing gymnastics, and taking homeschooling swimming lessons. The 
              writing class was really fun. It was with a tutor that my friend 
              Maddie's mom recomended. My friends Maddie and Emma were in it, 
              too. Leslie (the tutor) has a lot of ideas to get kids writing. 
              Maybe I'll put up one of the stories I wrote. Swimming lessons are 
              fun, too. I am now in Aquaquest 9. That means I can get my guide 
              swimming badge (oh, I neglected to mention that I'm in my second 
              year of guides). Too bad there isn't a badge for people who know 
              really long words, because I know the longest word in the english 
              language. (pnemonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconeosis) I hope 
              I spelled that right. (Scott, when you get this send me the right 
              spelling.) Well, back to the subject. I have been taking gym lessons 
              at Starr Gymnastics, and making a lot of progress. I still take 
              piano lessons, and am in level 4. </p>
            <p>Now for the really big news. I am in the Ottawa Childrens Choir. 
              I had a concert for Remembrance Day (Veterans day to Americans). 
              We were outside in the freezing rain for about an hour. I froze 
              even though I was wearing around 15 layers. I had a cold that was 
              getting better, and now it's worse! And, we have another outdoor 
              concert in December! </p>
            <p> Lately I have been reading a lot of Tamora Peirce books. I wonder 
              if any of you have read them. They include the books about Alanna 
              the lioness. I only have one more book before I've read them all. 
              She better get writing! I enjoy adventure stories. I also read the 
              first page of the first book of Proust. It looked interesting. Maybe 
              I will try it when I get a bit older. So far I haven't read Don 
              Quixote, but have read A Midsummer Night's Dream, and am hoping 
              I get some of Shakespeare's comedies for Christmas.</p>

      <h4>Ben's Corner</h4>
      
            <p>Ben enjoys seeing his cousins more often since he moved to Canada. 
            </p>
            <p>He has a strong passion for Lego, especially the Bionicles and 
              the Galidor series. The Bionicles are action figures that you build. 
              Galidor figures are creatures - mostly monsters and robots - that 
              can change body parts. For example, their arm might change into 
              a machine of some kind. Ben's dad thinks this would be handy when 
              doing home repairs. He'd like his arm to be able to change into 
              a cordless drill when he's at the top of a ladder and suddenly needs 
              one. (Oops, this was supposed to be Ben's corner.)</p>
            <p>Ben also attends a Beaver Group. Beavers are part of Scouting. 
              He's in his third year, so next year he can move on to Cubs. This 
              Beaver group is particularly rowdy, but it's still fun. They recently 
              spent the night at the Science and Technology Museum, with 250 other 
              Beavers and their parents and leaders. There was an electricity 
              show and a cryogenics show. They were both really good. In the electric 
              show, there was a &quot;chain of pain&quot; (with a Van der Graaf 
              generator at one end and static electricity shocks from one person 
              to the next). In the cryogenics show, the Beavers lay down on their 
              stomachs, and the demonstrator poured boiling water into liquid 
              nitrogen. The nitrogen boiled and flowed out in a huge cloud, covering 
              all the Beavers.</p>
            <p>We will ask Ben what else he wants to talk about. He'll probably 
              mention the fact that he learned to ride a bike this summer, etc.</p>
