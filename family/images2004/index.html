    <TD>Ruth's dad unexpectedly had open heart surgery on the 21st of December, 
      and Ruth left to be with her parents on the 23rd. The three remaining Urban 
      Shipleys had our Christmas together. Ruth's dad was home from the hospital 
      as of Christmas day. Things turned out well, and the other three Urban Shipleys 
      went down to see him on the 27th. The kids were very good sports about not 
      having their mom here for Christmas, even though it was hard at first. This 
      is the letter Santa left by their stockings. Sorry about the penmanship. 
      Santa is right-handed, but he's so busy filling stockings that he usually 
      writes his letters with his left hand.</TD>

    <TD COLSPAN=2><B>Dave has been working on constructing a play structure for 
      the kids.</B></TD>

    <TD>He started it last fall, and by late spring it looked like this. There 
      was a platform with a trap door and all the framing was done, but the roof 
      was just a tarp.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD align="center"><a href="playstructurejuly04.jpeg"><img src="playstructurejuly04-thumb.jpeg"></a></TD>
    <TD>By mid-summer, it looked like this. The roof was shingled, there was a 
      rope installed for climbing through the trap door, and some used windows 
      (from Habitat Restore) had been installed.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD align="center"><a href="playstructureoct04-2.jpeg"><img src="playstructureoct04-2-thumb.jpeg"></a></TD>
    <TD>By fall, the work was done for the year. This is what it looks like now.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD align="center"><a href="playstructureoct04-1.jpeg"><img src="playstructureoct04-1-thumb.jpeg"></a></TD>

    <TD COLSPAN=2><B>Dave had a chance to go to Iqaluit in May.</B></TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD align="center"><a href="iqaluit01.jpeg"><img src="iqaluit01-thumb.jpeg"></a></TD>
    <TD>Here is a collection of Iqaluit buildings. The white building on the right 
      is a primary school. There is a hotel behind it. The igloo-shaped building 
      on the left is the Anglican church, with the church hall behind it. Up on 
      the hill between them, the blue building is the high school. The schools 
      are both made of fibreglass, and nearly every building in town is built 
      on stilts, because of the perma-frost.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD align="center"><a href="iqaluit02.jpeg"><img src="iqaluit02-thumb.jpeg"></a></TD>
    <TD> Dave was in Iqaluit to help plan a new subdivision intended to be as 
      environmentally sustainable as possible, to be located on this site, overlooking 
      the town and Frobisher Bay beyond it.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD align="center"><a href="iqaluit03.jpeg"><img src="iqaluit03-thumb.jpeg"></a></TD>
    <TD>Frobisher Bay was still frozen and snow-covered when Dave was there.</TD>

    <TD>Rachel opened the show with a solo, out in front of the curtain with just 
      the director and accompanist. Without a microphone, she made herself heard 
      in a highschool auditorium with about 800 people in it. Sorry the shot is 
      a bit blurry - she had enough to think about without her dad setting off 
      his flash in the audience.</TD>

    <TD>Louisbourg is staffed by interpreters in costume and in character, who 
      stage re-enactments throughout the day. The kids had just seen one of the 
      townsfolk brought here to be pilloried (for public drunkenness, I believe). 
      They were trying it out themselves afterwards.</TD>
