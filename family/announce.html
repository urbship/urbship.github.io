Benjamin James Urban Shipley was born at 19 minutes after midnight on 17
May, 1996, at Meriter Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. He weighed 3.6 kg (8
pounds) and was 52 cm (20.5 inches) long. That's a little less than a fifth
of the weight of a curling rock and a little less than twice the diameter
of a curling rock.
