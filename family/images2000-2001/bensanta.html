Dear Santa
<P> 
Merry Christmas. How are the reindeer? Are they ready for the big trip? How is Mrs. Claus?
How are the elves? 
<P>
I am a Beaver. I like when we sit down at the meetings because it is quiet and good.
<P>
Now it's time for the present stuff. I would like Playmobil pirate sets - 3110 Admiral, 
3937 Pirate and Row Boat, and 3936 Pirate Captain. I would also like some dragon's castle 
Playmobil - 3888 Castle Defenders, 3317 Ghost, 3890 Baron, and 3024 Golden Knight.
<P>
I also like Lego. I would like #6437 Beach Buggy, #7312 T3-Trike, #7313 Red Planet Protector, 
and #7316 Excavation Searcher.
<P>
Dad asked me if I'd like a nice sweater for Christmas and I just laughed.
<P>
Have a good day at the Pole.
<P>
Love, BEN
