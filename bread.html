	Bread
      </H1>

<p>

<p>We have been baking bread with a bread machine for some time. My wife bakes 
  a very nice sandwich-style loaf using a recipe adapted from one given to us 
  by a friend. I found I still craved the occasional loaf of crusty, country-style 
  bread. It’s a type of bread we don’t know how to replicate in a bread machine, 
  so I bought it at our local <I>Whole Foods</I> store in Wisconsin. Since we 
  moved to Canada, and away from <I>Whole Foods</I>, I have not located a source 
  for this type of bread. I decided to take matters into my own hands. After a 
  certain amount of experimentation, I managed to create a <a href="sourdough.html">sourdough 
  recipe</a> that produced the kind of bread I wanted to eat.</p>
<p>The sourdough was well-received and has become part of our regular diet, but 
  another bread we missed was a cinnamon swirl bread from a store called <i>The 
  Bread Barn</i> in Madison. I set out to produce a new recipe that was at least 
  somewhat similar to that bread. After a false start last year, I tried again 
  this year. It took four loaves to get it right, but the resulting <a href="cinnamon.html">cinnamon swirl 
  recipe</A> is pretty much what we were looking for. This will likely become our 
  bread for special occasions and for treats to take to potlucks.</p>

<p>Bread is a very individual thing. These two recipes will not be to everyone’s 
  taste, but I really like being able to produce a loaf so close to my ideal.
