  Babysitting Cooperatives
</H1>
<P>
A babysitting cooperative is a group of families who exchange childcare.
The co-op usually provides some mechanism for keeping track of hours of
babysitting accumulated or used. Parents save money they might otherwise
pay babysitters, and can have reasonable confidence that their children are
cared for by other experienced parents.
<P>
A babysitting co-op in the town where we used to live had been in existence
for nearly 15 years when we first joined, and during that time has developed
stable structures and rules that keep it going, even though almost all of
the original families have now been replaced by new families. If you are
interested in setting up a co-op in your area, you might find some of the
information below useful. Some fledgling co-ops have asked if they can use
the material either directly or take it and modify it for their own use.
I asked that question at a semi-annual meeting when we were still members
and the answer was yes. If you wish to give credit to us, please credit "Westside
Babysitting Cooperative." Though I posted this material, I'm not really the
